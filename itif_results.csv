An AI Job Apocalypse? Watch This Chart,2025-11-04,Robert D. Atkinson,"This is it. This is really it: According to the doomsayers, we are witnessing the very moment in history when technology is finally starting to wipe out the labor market. The most precient reporting earlier this year solemnly recorded the unpleasant fact that artificial intelligence had triggered the beginning of a job apocalypse, which was said to be coming for white collar workers . (What? Not just blue collar workers?!?) And as of last week, it was no longer a prediction; the AI bloodbath was officially underway . JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Walmart, among many others, were all saying they expect to hold down headcount. Note bene: This is how an AI job apocalypse unfolds . But this hysteria will almost surely turn out to be false alarmism —the latest episode in a long series of historical panics over the specter of technology displacing human workers. As ITIF documented in 2017 , waves of automation have come for us many times before, but while they have certainly disrupted all sorts of occupations—from elevator operators to bowling pin setters—they have never wiped out demand for work. The truth is that technological disruption has no real bearing on total employment. Outside of a recession, the number of jobs in the economy will always equal the number of workers. Technologies that automate work just raise productivity, which raises incomes, which increases demand for everything people spend money on—from eating out, to having personal trainers, to renovating their homes—which creates work opportunities. It’s a neverending cycle. But the bigger picture in recent decades has been that occupational curn has been declining, not increasing, as evidenced by figure 1, which shows quarterly job losses as a share of total employment. Put aside the pandemic, and the trend has been inexorably downward… Figure 1: Quarterly job losses as a share of total employment Doomsayers will say this time is about to be different: After all, we’ve never before seen technology like AI hit the labor market. Which is true—just as earlier generations had never seen, say, mechanized farming. Until it happened. Then it changed things. But demand for work didn’t stop, because people’s demand for more bountiful lives is almost infinite. Therefore, the need to supply more bounty is almost infinite. Figure 1 is based on the last 30 years’ worth of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics series on Business Employment Dynamics (BDM) and Current Employment Statistics (CES). The most up-to-date datasets only cover 2024—before the dreaded AI job apocalyse allegedly began. So, let’s keep an eye on that trendline as more data comes out. Maybe it will jag upward, like a pandemic-caliber event, and lead to higher unemployment. But history suggests otherwise.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/04/an-ai-job-apocalypse-watch-this-chart/
The CCP’s Useful Idiots,2025-11-07,Robert D. Atkinson,"Vladimir Lenin reportedly referred to non-communist sympathizers as “deaf, dumb, and blind” individuals who would aid their own demise by helping the Soviet cause. During the 1920s and 1930s, there were plenty of actual communists—often underground—in the United States, Europe, and Asia doing Stalin’s bidding. But Lenin was referring to those who did Soviet communism’s bidding without realizing it (hence “deaf, dumb, and blind”). And in many ways, they were far more useful to Soviet communism’s goal of spreading the revolution globally than were official party members. The term eventually evolved into the now-familiar phrase “useful idiots.” Soviet apologist Walter Duranty, for example, was rightly called one for his uncritical regurgitation of Kremlin propaganda in the pages of The New York Times in the 1920s and 30s. But useful idiots extended beyond ideological or self-serving journalists; many were academics and writers, including famed author Doris Lessing and British philosopher Bertrand Russell. It’s a good term, and we see plenty of “useful idiots” today. They’re not carrying the Bolsheviks’ water, but the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP). They are not spies or paid agents, but rather useful idiots, spouting the CCP line by disparaging the West and praising China. There are so many today, it’s hard to know where to start. But let’s begin with an easy one: former World Economic Forum (WEF) director Klaus Schwab. During his reign, Schwab went out of his way to castigate Western capitalism, constantly calling for a new model because of its supposed sins, while at the same time praising the CCP. The self-flagellation included criticizing Western capitalism on the grounds that : Was he not aware that the phrase “harmonious societal development” is a CCP talking point used to attack the Western model of progress? Did he not know that China’s Gini coefficient—a measure of income inequality—is higher than that of most European nations, including his home country of Switzerland? Surely, with the WEF’s vast array of research assistants, one of them could have Googled this. This, from a man who told a Chinese forum that “We are coming out, thanks also to the leadership of China in terms of fighting the pandemic.” Given that China caused the pandemic and its 7.1 million deaths, you can’t make that up. But Klaus served it up to the Chinese with a straight face. In an interview with Chinese state media last year, he held up China as a “role model” for many countries. He then went on to add that the “Chinese model is certainly a very attractive model for quite a number of countries.” If he means a model built on stealing foreign intellectual property, massively subsidizing domestic firms to seize market share from competitors, and closing off domestic markets, then yes, China has one of the most “attractive” models around. This is all just standard fare for the WEF, which seems incapable of criticizing China or the CCP, but finds it open season on America and Western capitalism. One WEF article castigates America for being “closed”: Sounding like China Daily , WEF touts that China is “driving global growth,” “reshaping food systems,” and powering a “remarkable green transition.” If they mean deindustrializing the rest of the world and building more coal-fired power plants than any other nation, then we agree. In another article , the WEF goes on to say that China is even helping the world through its policies on rare earth minerals. Again, I can’t make this stuff up. Yes, that’s true, but only if “helping” means putting the rest of the world’s rare earth miners and processors out of business and using those minerals as a weapon to make countries and companies kowtow to Beijing. The article concludes with a plea for “a more balanced narrative [which] is the first step towards a coherent, globally coordinated policy response.” That is CCP-speak for “stop criticizing us.” But Europe is not the only home for the CCP’s useful idiots. The pacifist Quincy Institute blames Western capitalism for U.S.–China competition: Ah, if only the United States abandoned “neoliberalism,” the world would live in peace and harmony—just as Coca-Cola once promised us. But America’s shining example of a useful idiot is Columbia’s Jeffrey Sachs. Sachs sees nothing wrong with publishing in the CCP-run newspaper China Daily about U.S. decline, the failures of U.S. global leadership, and how China should instead become the global leader. He even appears on Chinese TV news shows, urging China and other countries to cooperate in order to resist the United States. His message: Trump is a bad nationalist; Xi is a wonderful globalist. He flatly argues that the United States should not lead the world and tells the CCP’s Global Times that he “really regrets American foreign policy toward China,” calling it “misguided and a serious mistake.” He also claims that China is the economic model for much of the rest of the world, especially developing nations. (Never mind that Chinese industrialization has actually stagnated industrial growth elsewhere—including in, you guessed it, other developing nations!) Jeff, perhaps you should move your classroom to Beijing since it is, in your view, the new shining city on a hill. As Michael Henningon wrote , “Useful idiots acknowledging that they were fools is rare, while flattery from tyrants can be a potent drug. Earning money and prestige from writing books about their experiences can also be part of their Faustian bargains .” So, it’s likely too much to expect the Schwabs and Sachses of the world to wake the @#$! up. But it’s not too late for the rest of us to recognize their propagandizing for what it really is.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/07/the-ccps-useful-idiots/
Fact of the Week: University Patents Underpinned 50 Percent of FDA-approved Drugs,2025-11-03,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: Kevin Gardner and Michael Kinch, “We Set Out to Quantify U.S. Academic Contributions To Medicines. The Results Stunned Even Us,” STAT10 , June 6, 2025. Commentary: Universities have become an engine for innovation in the United States, conducting research that has become the backbone of American advanced industries, including the pharmaceutical industry. Throughout the 20th century, private firms held the majority of patents and were responsible for most innovations that occurred in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 changed the status quo for American innovation, enabling universities to retain patent rights to inventions developed with federal funding. Since the Act was passed, universities have played a growing role in supporting innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, with 50 percent of FDA-approved drugs today relying on (at least some) applied research originating in universities.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/03/university-patents-underpinned-50-percent-fda-approved-drugs/
How the Digital Markets Act Let Consumers Down Consumer Complaints Time to Reassess the DMA,2025-11-07,Lilla Nóra Kiss,"During the Business Software Alliance’s TRANSFORM forum last week in Washington, DC, Jovita Neliupšienė, the European Union’s ambassador to the United States, joked that Brussels is “not deregulating but simplifying—so that if not a fifth grader, at least a sixth grader could do business in Europe.” The audience laughed, but for millions of EU consumers, the truth is exactly the opposite. Doing anything online in Europe rarely feels simple these days. The Digital Markets Act (DMA), introduced to create fairer, more open digital markets, was meant to make technology easier, safer, and more affordable. Yet an ECIPE report conducted across seven Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries suggests the DMA has brought neither the simplicity nor the consumer benefits its architects promised: services have become clunkier, privacy has turned into a paid feature, and small firms remain no more competitive than before. The consumer complaints captured in ECIPE’s study can be grouped into three broad categories that reveal how the DMA has failed to deliver on its promises: Increased friction and lost functionality Privacy and choice paradoxes Stalled contestability and chilled innovation The DMA’s design-for-compliance model has added friction, slowed tasks, and degraded user experience, resulting in inconvenience for consumers. This friction is both functional (extra steps and degraded usability) and cognitive (confusion and decision fatigue). For example: Everyday tasks have become more complicated. Although the DMA touted frictionless digital experiences for consumers, according to the report, nearly four in ten respondents said they now need more steps to complete simple online actions than before. One-third of these same respondents said that digital services feel more confusing post-DMA. For instance, consumers cited additional consent clicks, fragmented features, and intrusive choice screens. Per se rules have produced real impediments. The DMA treats designated gatekeepers under a default strict liability standard: conduct is banned automatically, without evidence of specific consumer harm. For example, rules against “self-preferencing” forced the removal of integrated modules—such as Google Maps previews or shopping snippets—from search results. Consumers told surveyors this made searches more time-consuming, while no evidence shows that rivals gained significant new traffic. More affordability and lower prices remain elusive. The European Commission’s rhetoric of “more competition, lower prices” doesn’t appear to have reached ordinary users. Across the CEE region, where digital adoption is high but competition awareness remains low, the report found little sign of cheaper or better value digital services following the DMA’s introduction. As the report noted, “the promise of better services at fairer prices thus rings hollow so far—improvements are either too subtle, too inconvenient, or too opaque for consumers to appreciate.” The DMA’s privacy and interoperability rules were meant to empower users, but in practice, they are hurting them. For example: Consumers do not want to buy privacy. The DMA has forced platforms like Meta to introduce paid “ad-free” subscriptions, monetizing privacy as a premium feature. However, the report found that only a small minority of users are willing to pay for ad-free or data-minimized versions of services, while around two-thirds continue to exchange personal data for access to free platforms. As such, the DMA appears to have highly overestimated consumers’ willingness to pay for alleged extra privacy safeguards. Interoperability has brought security worries instead of more choices. The DMA mandates that operating systems enable greater interoperability for third parties as a way to encourage openness. Yet the report indicates that only a small share of users noticed these interoperability options, and among those who did, most expressed growing concern about cybersecurity and data protection. While the DMA was intended to target gatekeepers, it overlooked how consumers actually behave. People have not switched to alternative platforms, European tech rivals have not grown, and innovation has chilled across the EU. For example: Contestability has remained theoretical, and small businesses are still invisible online. The central promise of the DMA was to boost contestability and scale up European rivals. According to the report, around 70 percent of respondents still use Google Search multiple times a day, and more than 75 percent use Facebook daily. In other words, user behavior data still show traffic flowing overwhelmingly to well-known, larger brands. Innovation has taken a backseat, and Europe has become the “last-to-launch” market. Over the past two years, several high-profile services and features have arrived in the EU after other regions. As the ECIPE report noted, the launch of Meta’s Threads app in the EU was delayed several months amid uncertainty about data use. Additionally, Apple postponed the rollout of Apple Intelligence, citing DMA interoperability obligations. Ambassador Jovita Neliupšienė’s quip about making business simple enough for a sixth grader captured the spirit Europe needs. Yet the DMA, in its current form, is anything but simple—for consumers or small firms. If Brussels is serious about its “simplification agenda,” it should start by reassessing the DMA: remove rules that add friction without value and measure success through consumer welfare, not compliance checklists.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/07/how-the-digital-markets-act-let-consumers-down/
National Cyber Director Cairncross Is Right to Emphasize Preemptive Cyber Defense,2025-11-04,David Kertai,"At his first major public address since his Senate confirmation, National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross, on September 9, outlined a directive signaling a shift in U.S. cyber strategy from absorbing the costs of cyber attacks to imposing them on adversaries. While not entirely new, this approach echoes other voices in the Trump administration calling for the United States to take a more proactive cyber stance . As Cairncross begins his tenure to accomplish his goals, he should focus on three priorities: modernizing the 2015 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA 2015), reaffirming federal leadership in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program, and institutionalizing cybersecurity coordination with allies. Cairncross’s first priority should be working with Congress to not only reauthorize CISA 2015 but also modernize it. This law, passed in 2015, established the foundation for public-private cyber threat information sharing by granting companies liability protections and encouraging cross-sector participation. Allowing the law to lapse leaves both the government and industry without clear mechanisms for timely data exchange , weakening collective security . To address this, reauthorization should go beyond simply extending the law’s expiration date to ensure long-term stability and rebuild trust between government and industry. While Congress has the authority to reauthorize CISA 2015, the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) should influence the process by advocating for reforms , such as multi-year renewals tied to clear threat-reduction metrics . For example, Congress could structure appropriations over three- to five-year cycles, with continued funding contingent on measurable outcomes such as timely sharing of critical vulnerabilities, successful mitigation by participating organizations, and reductions in the time between threat detection and disclosure. Linking funding to performance rather than politics would prevent future lapses during congressional gridlock and provide predictable operational stability. Another priority should be the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures program, which catalogs cybersecurity flaws. CVE’s standardized identifiers and centralized database enable coordination worldwide, but a funding scare earlier this year nearly ended the program, prompting the use of alternatives, such as the EU’s Vulnerability Database and the U.S. nonprofit CVE Foundation . This moment gives Cairncross and the Trump administration a chance to modernize and secure CVE's future by working with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to reaffirm federal stewardship through sustained funding and governance. The near-shutdown in April, only averted by an 11-month contract extension, revealed CVE’s reliance on short-term contracts. A long-term funding model, whether through a trust or stable appropriation, would prevent future disruption and preserve CVE as the single globally trusted source for vulnerability data, without which, governments and vendors could splinter across competing databases, weakening coordinated threat response. ONCD should also support CISA’s efforts to modernize the CVE program by broadening participation , including the involvement of international partners, academia, open-source communities, and vulnerability tool providers in governance. Establishing a technical advisory board could help keep CVE neutral, global, and resilient. ONCD should further accelerate automation and streamline CVE assignments to improve data accuracy and speed, especially during crises like Log4Shell in 2021, when delays and inconsistent vulnerability listings left organizations unsure which systems were at risk, slowing coordinated response . Faster, more accurate CVE data would give defenders a shared, real-time picture of active threats, allowing them to prioritize patches before attackers can exploit them. Finally, as Cairncross noted in his remarks, the United States should take proactive steps in cyberspace, including monitoring adversaries’ activities and disrupting attacks before they spread, but it cannot do so alone, as adversaries like Russia and China operate globally and exploit gaps across countries’ networks and regions faster than a single nation can respond. To proactively strengthen collective defense, ONCD should make allied cooperation a central pillar of U.S. cyber strategy. Building on frameworks like the EU’s Cyber Blueprint —which outlines a coordinated, multi-step response process for EU member states during major cyber incidents—ONCD should establish similar standing mechanisms with allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, who face growing cyber threats. Such mechanisms could enable joint threat-hunting, real-time incident response, and shared vulnerability management. Regular cross-border exercises and synchronized disclosure timelines would further help allies detect, respond to, and recover from attacks together, closing gaps that adversaries currently exploit. Cairncross wants to shift from reactive defense to active cyber deterrence. Achieving that vision requires revitalizing foundational policies. Modernizing CISA 2015 will sustain trusted information sharing. Reaffirming federal leadership in the CVE program will preserve a unified vulnerability ecosystem. Institutionalizing allied coordination will raise the costs for adversaries and strengthen collective resilience. By advancing these priorities, Cairncross can turn strategic intent into durable policy, laying the groundwork for a more assertive and resilient U.S. cyber posture.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/04/national-cyber-director-cairncross-is-right-to-emphasize-preemptive-cyber-defense/
"Comments to the FCC Regarding Reducing Barriers and Accelerating Network Modernization Introduction and Summary Broadband Convergence Is Creating Competition, and Rules Preventing Network Retirement Are Out of Step with Market Realities Any Resource Spent Maintaining Legacy Networks Could Have Gone to Deploying Next-Generation Networks Instead Conclusion Endnotes",2025-11-05,Ellis Scherer,"The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) appreciates the opportunity to reply to comments regarding accelerating network modernization and reducing barriers to network improvements and service changes. [1] The record shows broad support for eliminating regulatory roadblocks to the retirement of legacy copper networks and the transition to next-generation broadband technologies, and ITIF supports this effort, as well. [2] Robust competition in the broadband market and the rollout of newer technologies make copper networks, and the regulations preventing their retirement, obsolete. Maintenance of legacy networks is becoming untenable, and consumers are best served when ISPs use resources to upgrade and deploy next-generation networks instead of sinking them into propping up a worse technology. As such, removing barriers to network improvements and upgrades is necessary for ensuring every American has the best service that modern broadband has to offer. Technologies like fiber, fixed wireless, coax cable, and low-earth-orbit satellite now offer substitutable services. This technological convergence has created greater competition in the broadband market. [3] This competition leads to consumer benefits like lower service prices and bundle options as providers try to find ways to differentiate from competitors. [4] Today, over 94% of broadband serviceable locations have at least two providers to choose from. [5] Today’s marketplace features robust competition, so outdated regulations that were enacted when incumbent local exchange carriers dominated the market are no longer relevant and should be eliminated. Outdated rules, like notice requirements under section 251(c)(5), harm consumers by standing in the way of timely network upgrades and are no longer necessary for creating a competitive market. Forbearance from section 251(c)(5) rules is a good approach because it will prevent unnecessary rules from continuing to slow the pace of progress and will allow incumbent local exchange carriers to upgrade their networks to become stronger competitors. Only about eight percent of U.S. homes still use copper for broadband access, as almost everyone in the country is covered by newer technologies. [6] But these regulations prevent ISPs from retiring unused copper networks in areas already served by these newer technologies. Money, workers, and equipment cannot be used on modern high-capacity networks if they are instead being used for upkeep on obsolete copper ones. Meanwhile, the tools and components needed to fix copper systems are becoming rare and expensive because they are no longer widely manufactured. [7] That means longer outages and slower repairs for anyone still stuck with a copper connection. As the record supports, it is high time for the Commission to remove unnecessary regulations that stand in the way of next-generation network deployment, and to do so in a manner that ensures consumers do not lose access to critical emergency services. Careful, strategic regulatory reform will create a future where every American has a high-speed broadband connection provided by the modern technology of their choice. Thank you for your consideration. [1] . Founded in 2006, ITIF is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute—a think tank.

"Defense Right-to-Repair Proposals Shouldn’t Compromise IP, Innovation, or Safety",2025-11-07,Stephen Ezell,"Military readiness and sustainment represent a vital imperative; in fact, of the six “top Department of Defense (DOD) management and performance challenges” identified in a recent DOD Inspector General report , “Increasing Military Readiness” ranked first. It’s certainly critical that the DOD has access to the data and information it and U.S. servicemembers need to conduct maintenance, repair, and overhaul of defense systems. However, it’s also crucial that companies which have invested private resources to innovate defense technologies and systems—many of which have commercial product applications—retain ownership of the novel intellectual property (IP) they’ve created. Unfortunately, legislation currently circulating in Congress to advance aggressive right-to-repair (RTR) provisions would upset the delicate balance Congress and the DOD have long tried to maintain in protecting contractors’ IP rights while preserving DOD access to critical data and information regarding weapons systems. The proposed legislation represents a solution in search of a problem, and one that would unnecessarily undermine incentives for private-sector defense innovation. In the Senate, Section 835 of the Senate Armed Services Committee-passed FY 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) proposes a concept called “instructions for continued operational readiness” (ICOR) as a mandatory requirement of all future defense contracts. As the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) explains , “ICOR includes data, tools, and software for operations, maintenance, installation, and training, which could include sensitive and proprietary technical and manufacturing data and IP developed at the contractor’s private expense.” The proposed legislation would allow the DOD to provide these parts, tools, and information to any authorized third-party contractor, including an innovative contractor’s direct competitors. The proposal further authorizes “alternative maintenance or repair actions” for equipment, which could include reverse engineering or fabrication of parts by the DOD or third parties. The proposed legislation would give DOD the ability to impose fines or penalties for non-compliance (i.e., if the contractor didn’t comply with the request for compelled disclosure of information) and incorporates no appeals process. The House Armed Services Committee-passed FY 2026 NDAA (H.R. 3838) includes a similar RTR proposal, which would mandate that contractors agree to allow DOD “fair and reasonable” access to all repair tools and information, including proprietary IP, which DOD could then provide to third parties, even direct competitors. It also includes a provision that contractors would have to offer repair materials at a price that is equivalent to or better than the most favorable prices, terms, and conditions offered to a reseller or distributor. (This ignores that companies have varying business models and often offer discounts when customers are purchasing in bulk quantities.) But the core concern is that both proposals would essentially require contractors to agree to license their privately funded commercial or defense-unique IP to aftermarket competitors (for virtually any purpose)—so long as there would be some connection to operational readiness—as a condition of contracting. The proposed legislation is disruptive—and foundationally unnecessary. That’s so because the government already possesses the rights needed to maintain or repair defense equipment under existing laws and regulations. Under current DOD contracts, the government obtains “unlimited rights” in any deliverable technical data necessary for operation, maintenance, installation, or training (other than detailed manufacturing or process data) as well as in deliverable technical data of technology development fully funded by the government. And even when contractors have fully funded technology development at their own expense, the government obtains “limited rights” in deliverable technical data (including disclosure externally for emergency repair and overhaul). It’s also important to note that Congress has already provided two different authorities to incorporate contractor depot artisans into their organic depot capabilities. (“Contractor depot artisans” refers to highly skilled tradespeople working in a specific depot environment, often a military maintenance or manufacturing facility, to repair, upgrade, or build complex equipment and systems.) So, while the current legislation is being sold on the Hill as being about “a U.S. servicemember’s right-to-repair,” the reality is that when servicemembers are required to perform a repair or when a government employee at a service depot performs a repair, the existing Limited Rights of Commercial Rights license allows DOD personnel to perform a needed repair. A further concern about the legislation is that while proponents contend the provisions would only apply to routine maintenance and repair information, it could also apply to detailed manufacturing or process data (so-called “DMPD”), design methods, source codes, algorithms, or trade secrets. Further, while the Senate legislation contains a carve-out in its provisions for “unmodified commercial products,” there are no exemptions from the proposed rules for “modified commercial products” or for privately financed commercial or defense-unique products. As the NDIA correctly notes, “When a company develops new technology, it has potential future value, not only for the DOD but also for the commercial market,” but if a company risks compromising its IP if it does business with the government, it may simply decide not to do so in the first place. For instance, in NDIA’s Vital Signs 2025 Survey , 37 percent of private-sector respondents reported their company decided not to include certain technologies in defense contract bids because of IP concerns (an increase of 9 percentage points over the previous year’s survey). Further, 36 percent of private-sector respondents chose not to bid on certain DOD contracts “out of fear that DOD requirements for IP would put the company’s IP rights at risk.” That response rate represented an increase of 14 percent from the prior year. As NDIA notes, the data show “that even before the RTR mandates, more companies are already choosing not to contract with DOD over fear of losing their IP,” a situation which would certainly be worsened by the proposed Congressional RTR mandates. The proposed right-to-repair legislation also raises potentially serious safety and liability concerns, especially in the defense environment. As NDIA observes , “Manufacturing an aileron for a military aircraft outside of an extremely controlled environment with highly trained personnel would simply introduce too great a risk to the performance of the aircraft or the safety of the pilot.” Congress should not be compelling the disclosure of data that would empower third parties that really shouldn’t be in the business of modifying or repairing complex aeronautical components. In fact, that’s one reason why, on the commercial side, the Federal Aviation Administration has decided not to disclose certain type data on jet engines; it doesn’t want third parties with no business repairing commercial jet engines doing so. Further to this point, forcing the disclosure of contractors’ proprietary data could facilitate IP misappropriation by interna­tional competitors, including potential U.S. adversaries. As noted at the outset, it’s of course critical that the DOD has access to the information it needs to maintain and repair weapons systems, but to the extent there are gaps in the DOD’s current ability to do so, there are better approaches to address this gap than the proposed Congressional RTR legislation. One innovative approach would be to implement a “Data as a Service” (DaaS) model. Under this concept, the DOD could contract for access to a defense contractor’s full technical library on a “pay-per-use” basis, so that the DOD could access and use data for specific repairs when needed, ensuring needed defense readiness while allowing a contractor to protect its IP from broad disclosure. It’s also important that servicemembers and policymakers alike be better educated on the full extent of existing authorities. At a time when the DOD is trying to encourage more private-sector capital to flow into defense innovation, it’s not the time to roll out RTR rules that could potentially compel the forced disclosure of proprietary IP. In a July 2025 House Armed Services Committee hearing on “Reforming Defense Acquisition to Deliver Capability at the Speed of Relevance,” the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Michael Duffy, stated that the DOD is striving to find “a balance between preserving the intellectual property and providing the department with the access we need,” further noting that “the innovation of industry and the protection of that intellectual property is clearly a [U.S.] competitive advantage.” That’s precisely right. It’s very difficult to achieve innovation without the protection of ideas. Protecting private-sector IP rights is certainly in the long-term interest of U.S. national security and defense innovation. Policymakers on the Hill should reconsider the overly extensive RTR rules being proposed in the currently circulating House and Senate FY 2026 NDAA proposals.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/07/defense-right-to-repair-proposals-shouldnt-compromise-ip-innovation-or-safety/
Big Tech Goes to SCOTUS? Google’s Petition in Epic v. Google Makes the Case,2025-11-04,Joseph V. Coniglio,"Following the Ninth Circuit’s decision to uphold a series of draconian remedies against Google in the long-running Epic v. Google litigation, Google is now seeking to take its case before the Supreme Court. In a petition filed last week, Google raised a number of important legal questions ripe for the Supreme Court’s consideration—most notably: What should the legal standard be for assessing whether its series of revenue sharing, preinstallation, and distribution agreements were anticompetitive? And did the relief imposed, including a heavy-handed catalog sharing remedy that gives third-party app stores access to Google Play Store’s extensive network of apps, go beyond the scope of proper antitrust relief? These questions are not only critical to resolving Epic v. Google but also implicate similar errors in Judge Mehta’s liability and remedy decisions in the concurrent DOJ v. Google search case. The first and most important issue Google raises concerns the rule that was applied to determine whether it acted anticompetitively. Specifically, Google’s practices were evaluated under the rule of reason, which, in its standard formulation as set forth by the Supreme Court in cases like NCAA v. Alston , involves a three-step test: first, the plaintiff presents evidence that the conduct resulted in anticompetitive harm; second, the burden shifts to the defendant to provide a procompetitive justification for its practices; and third, the burden goes back to the plaintiff to show that those benefits could have been achieved through alternatives less restrictive of competition. If the plaintiff can meet its burden at step one and, if necessary, step three, the behavior is anticompetitive and illegal. If not, the defendant wins. As Google explains, that’s not what happened here. Rather, the District Court adopted a test in which anticompetitive harms were balanced directly against procompetitive effects, without assessing whether less restrictive alternatives existed. To be sure, courts may allow plaintiffs to prevail under the rule of reason even if they fail the third step of demonstrating the existence of a less restrictive alternative—provided they can prove that anticompetitive harms outweigh procompetitive gains. But this four-step rule of reason is typically applied where the focus is on contractual tying, such as the Ninth Circuit’s County of Tuolumne decision. And while the practice of Google Play Store requiring the use of Google Play Billing for in-app purchases could fall into that bucket, at its core Epic v. Google concerns intrabrand restrictions on Android. An analogous mistake with applying the rule of reason can be found in Judge Mehta’s decision in the search case. In holding that Google’s allegedly exclusive default search distribution agreements with third-party browsers, Android OEMs, and wireless carriers were anticompetitive, Judge Mehta laid out the four-step rule of reason described above: first, a plaintiff shows anticompetitive harm; next, a defendant responds by showing procompetitive benefits; and then the burden returns to the plaintiff to show either that there were less restrictive means to achieve those benefits or that they are outweighed by the anticompetitive harms. However, this was the wrong test. Under the U.S. v. Microsoft standard that Judge Mehta applied, there is no room for discounting procompetitive justifications on the grounds that less restrictive alternatives might exist. Indeed, for exclusive dealing generally, a least restrictive alternative analysis is not usually conducted; courts instead simply balance harms against benefits. In addition to its concerns with the legal standard applied at the liability phase, Google’s Supreme Court petition in Epic v. Google takes major issue with the catalog sharing remedy imposed upon Google. In general, antitrust remedies—which can take the form of prohibitory injunctions preventing a company from engaging in certain behavior, affirmative obligations requiring a company to take proactive measures, and, in exceptional circumstances, breakups or other structural relief—can serve three purposes: terminating the illegal monopolization, undoing the fruits of the violation, and preventing future anticompetitive practices. Within this scheme, the catalog sharing remedy represents an affirmative obligation for Google to undo the fruits of its statutory violation by giving third-party app stores access to Google Play Store’s catalog of apps. This effectively results in Google losing a key network advantage that makes its Play Store more attractive to users: a greater catalog of apps. But in upholding this remedy as a “‘reasonable method’ of counteracting the Play Store’s dominance and reducing the network effects it enjoys by temporarily lowering barriers to entry,” the Ninth Circuit seems to have erred. Specifically, the “reasonable method” standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Nat’l Soc’y Professional Engineers applies either to, as in that case, prohibitory injunctions to undo the fruits of anticompetitive behavior or, as the Massachusetts v. Microsoft case made clear, affirmative obligations designed to terminate the anticompetitive effects of the illegal monopoly. It should not apply to affirmative obligations intended to deny the fruits of anticompetitive behavior, which, as the latter court explained, require a higher standard mandating that “the fruits of a violation must be identified before they may be denied.” Yet the catalog sharing remedy makes no effort to distinguish between app network effects achieved through anticompetitive versus procompetitive means. This error is repeated in the relief approved by Judge Mehta in the Google search case. Specifically, while rightly rejecting the DOJ’s radical proposal to force Google to divest Chrome and potentially Android, Judge Mehta similarly imposed a series of data sharing remedies that, as he made clear, “are designed primarily to deny Google a key fruit of its anticompetitive conduct—scale—and to help rivals overcome that deficit.” In particular, Judge Mehta required Google to share certain search index and user-interaction data with competitors to help improve their own search services. However, like the Ninth Circuit, Judge Mehta merely asked whether this relief was a “reasonable method of eliminating the consequences of the illegal conduct,” rather than precisely identifying which data constituted the fruits of Google’s anticompetitive behavior, as opposed to data Google obtained through the normal, procompetitive operation of its search service. The Supreme Court doesn’t take many cases a year, and major antitrust decisions from the Court, as this one would be, are always quite rare. However, amidst the number of landmark antitrust cases against Big Tech companies that will, whichever way they are decided, have huge implications both for antitrust law and the American economy, the Epic v. Google case presents a unique opportunity for the Supreme Court to head off potential legal confusion by providing necessary guidance in two key areas where Judge Mehta in the Google search case also appears to have erred. Specifically, by clarifying which version of the rule of reason applies to different forms of conduct and what level of scrutiny should govern affirmative obligation remedies intended to divest the fruits of anticompetitive behavior, the Court can lay out a much-needed framework to guide lower courts as they adjudicate these once-in-a-generation antitrust actions against Big Tech.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/04/big-tech-goes-to-scotus-google-petition-in-epic-v-google-makes-the-case/
Decoupling Risks: How Semiconductor Export Controls Could Harm US Chipmakers and Innovation Key Takeaways Introduction Modeling the Economic Impact of Semiconductor Export Controls Impact of Export Controls on U.S. Semiconductor Firms Medium-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market Long-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market Impact on ICT Industries Conclusion Appendix: Methodology Endnotes,2025-11-10,Trelysa Long,"U.S. export controls on semiconductor sales to China reduce U.S. chipmakers’ revenues, lower their R&D investment capabilities, and reduce industry employment. As such, U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 3 Modeling the Economic Impact of Semiconductor Export Controls 4 Impact of Export Controls on U.S. Semiconductor Firms 6 Medium-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 10 Long-Term Foregone Growth and Resulting Market 14 Impact on ICT Industries 17 Conclusion . 19 Appendix: Methodology 20 Endnotes 25 Semiconductors constitute the foundation of the global digital economy, generating $631 billion in global sales in 2024, and is projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030, while enabling more than $7 trillion in annual downstream economic activity in fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, and advanced manufacturing. [1] This represents roughly 7 percent of the world’s economic activity. [2] This report examines a hypothetical scenario in which the United States implements broader export controls and policies that effectively decouple U.S. semiconductor firms from the Chinese market. In reality, the United States has only implemented a limited set of export controls aimed at slowing China’s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies for military and high-performance computing applications. For example, in October 2022, the Biden administration issued export controls restricting the sale of AI chips to China, along with technology to manufacture those chips. [3] Following that, in January 2025, the Department of Commerce announced a proposed AI diffusion rule that implemented a three-tiered system for access to advanced AI hardware, capping the number of advanced chips that foreign nations could receive. [4] However, those proposed rules were rescinded by the Trump administration. [5] On the other hand, the Chinese government could also impose similar restrictions on U.S. firms, resulting in a lost of access to the Chinese market. Indeed, because the Chinese government banned Micron products in critical infrastructure in 2023, the U.S. chip company intends to stop supplying server chips to China altogether. [6] Even within this limited framework, restrictions carry potential risks. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s (ITIF’s) economic model shows that reducing access to Chinese commercial markets in a decoupling scenario would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers, which in turn could lower investment in research and development (R&D), the primary driver of next-generation chips and long-term competitiveness in the industry. Slower revenue growth and innovation would not only weaken the global position of U.S. firms, but could also ripple across the broader economy by affecting high-skill jobs in semiconductor design and manufacturing and downstream employment in industries reliant on chips. In short, reduced revenues and fewer jobs would only end up harming American chip firms and American workers. This report develops an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls if they were to lead to a full decoupling from the Chinese market. It provides the logic of the economic model followed by a summary of the semiconductor industry in 2024, which serve as the baseline for the model. Subsequently, the report estimates the initial impact of full decoupling on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues and R&D investments, before examining the impact on industry jobs and downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. In addition, the report estimates the market share and foregone revenue, as well as R&D investments and job losses, in both the short term and long term, assuming a full decoupling scenario. It then provides summaries of the impact from other scenarios of decoupling, such as 25 percent decoupling. The report concludes by exploring the impact of decoupling on specific information and communications technology (ICT) industry sectors. ITIF developed an economic model to estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China. This model estimates U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue, R&D investments, and jobs impact from four export control/decoupling scenarios: 1) full decoupling or export ban (U.S. companies are completely prohibited from selling to China); 2) 50 percent decoupling (U.S. semiconductors restricted selling to China, leading to a 50 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market); 3) 25 percent decoupling (some U.S. semiconductors cannot be sold to China, leading to a 25 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market); and 4) Entity List-based decoupling (U.S. companies cannot sell to a list of specific Chinese companies, leading to a 10 percent revenue loss from the Chinese market). (See the appendix for the full methodology.) The rationale behind the four decoupling scenarios is as follows. The United States will try to place export controls on the most important semiconductor products first before expanding the list. As such, the Entity List will first cut off some Chinese companies from a few key semiconductor products, leading U.S. firms to lose 10 percent of revenue from the Chinese market. However, gradually, the United States will expand export controls to encompass all semiconductor products, leading to a full decoupling between the two nations. This would mean that U.S. semiconductor firms would lose all their revenue from the Chinese market. The economic model measures the extent of negative impact U.S. export controls could have on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue and share of the global industry. Assuming that the United States does not utilize the Foreign Direct Product Rule, U.S. firms’ losses could be gained by other nations, including China, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and others. Using the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and the Semiconductor Industry Association’s (SIA’s) “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain” report, ITIF estimated the global market shares of each nation for each semiconductor product in 2022. [7] (See figure 1.) Figure 1: Global market share of each semiconductor product type [8] Using this as a proxy for future global shares by nation, ITIF estimated the extent to which other nations could benefit from the lost U.S. revenue by removing the United States and scaling the remaining nations’ shares. As a result of U.S. firms’ revenue losses, their investment in R&D would also be reduced. As SIA found, U.S. semiconductor companies invested 17.7 percent of their revenue into R&D in 2024. [9] Every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. Furthermore, the revenue losses would also mean that U.S. semiconductor companies may be unable to offer as many jobs, leading to a decline in the industry’s employment numbers. This decline would subsequently result in fewer downstream jobs being created in the U.S. economy. Indeed, as SIA found, every job in the semiconductor industry supports an additional 5.7 downstream jobs in the U.S. economy . [10] In sum, revenue losses would result in fewer jobs, reduced R&D investment, and a lower global market share for U.S. chipmakers. Figure 2 illustrates the analytical framework ITIF’s model uses to estimate the economic impact of U.S. semiconductor export controls on U.S. semiconductor firms and the U.S. economy. Figure 2: ITIF’s analytical framework for modeling the effects of U.S. semiconductor export controls on China The following sections provide background information on the global semiconductor market, the U.S. semiconductor market, China’s semiconductor market, and U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of the Chinese market in 2024. Afterward, they examine the initial impact of a full decoupling with China on U.S. firms’ revenue and other nations’ firms’ revenue. In addition, the section provides a summary of the impact of the three other decoupling scenarios: 50 percent decoupling, 25 percent decoupling, and Entity List-based export controls. The report later examines the extent to which each decoupling scenario would impact U.S. semiconductor firms’ R&D investment levels, before turning to the impact on jobs. In 2024, the global semiconductor industry generated $630.5 billion in revenue, of which U.S. semiconductor firms accounted for 50.4 percent. [11] Meanwhile, Chinese semiconductor firms accounted for 4.5 percent, or $28.4 billion. [12] China demands more chips than it produces. In 2024, China demanded 24 percent, or $151.3 billion, of the global semiconductor market. [13] Given U.S. semiconductor firms’ large market share, they supplied 50.7 percent of China’s demand in 2024. [14] (See table 1.) Table 1: Semiconductor market measures, 2024 [15] Measure Value (Billions) Share Global semiconductor market $631 100.0% Chinese firms’ global market share $28 4.5% China’s demand of global market $151 24.0% U.S. firms’ global market share $318 50.4% U.S. firms’ share of China market $77 50.7% China’s demand for semiconductors varies by type. For example, China’s computing and information technology (IT) industries may require logic chips such as central processing units, while a phone maker would need more memory chips and an electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer more sensors and microcontrollers. As such, using the SIA 2025 Factbook’s share of global demand for each semiconductor product type as a proxy, ITIF estimated China’s demand for each product type in 2024. [16] The top three semiconductor product types most demanded include logic chips (34 percent), memory chips (26 percent), and analog chips (13 percent). (See figure 3.) Figure 3: China’s chip demand by semiconductor product types [17] Since U.S. firms fulfill a significant share of China’s demand, export controls or full decoupling could have a severe impact on U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues. They would eliminate, or at least partially reduce, U.S. firms’ ability to sell to China, thereby reducing U.S. firms’ overall revenue. In this section, ITIF uses 2024 as a baseline to estimate the revenue U.S. firms could lose and other nations’ firms could gain in the initial year after decoupling with China. Table 3 shows the potential revenue losses of U.S. firms by semiconductor product type after a full decoupling from China and the nations that could gain from U.S. firms’ losses. In the event of a complete decoupling, U.S. firms would no longer sell to China, meaning they would lose 100 percent of their revenue from China. In this scenario, U.S. firms could lose about $77 billion from complete decoupling with China. Meanwhile, mainland Chinese firms could gain about $9 billion, EU firms $15 billion, Japanese firms $12 billion, Taiwanese firms $14 billion, South Korean firms $21 billion, and other nations’ firms $5 billion of those losses.

U.S. firms could lose as much as $38.4 billion in revenue in the face of 50 percent decoupling with China. Of this, mainland Chinese firms could gain about $5 billion, South Korean firms $10 billion, and Taiwanese firms $7 billion. Under 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could lose about $19 billion while mainland Chinese firms could gain about $2 billion, Japanese ones $3 billion, and Taiwanese firms $4 billion. Lastly, under an Entity Listing against Chinese companies, U.S. firms could lose about $8 billion while mainland Chinese firms gain $1 billion, the EU’s firms $2 billion, and South Korea’s firms $2 billion. (See table 3.) Table 3: Foreign semiconductor firms’ potential gains from U.S. firms’ losses (billions) [19] Decoupling Scenarios United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Full decoupling -$76.7 $9.1 $12.3 $14.1 $15.3 $20.6 $5.3 50% decoupling -$38.4 $4.5 $6.2 $7.0 $7.7 $10.3 $2.7 25% decoupling -$19.2 $2.3 $3.1 $3.5 $3.8 $5.1 $1.3 Entity List -$7.7 $0.9 $1.2 $1.4 $1.5 $2.1 $0.5 The U.S. semiconductor industry invests a significant share of its revenue in R&D to develop the next generation of globally competitive chips. In 2024 alone, the industry invested 17.7 percent of its revenue in R&D, and, on average, invested 18.3 percent from 2015 to 2024. As such, given that U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues would decline from decoupling with China, R&D investments would also decline. Generally, the share of revenue invested in R&D would also decline when revenue declines, but ITIF kept the share constant for a more conservative estimate. The U.S. semiconductor industry invested $56.2 billion in R&D in 2024. However, if the United States fully decouples from China, U.S. firms’ R&D investments could decrease to about $43 billion, roughly $14 billion lower than the status quo. This is calculated by multiplying the industry’s R&D intensity by the lost revenues from precluded sales to China. Meanwhile, U.S. firms would likely reduce R&D investments to about $49 billion, or about $7 billion lower than the status quo, under 50 percent decoupling. Further, U.S. firms could reduce R&D investments to about $53 billion (about $3 billion lower than status quo) and $55 billion (about $1 billion lower) from 25 percent decoupling or export control entity listing, respectively. (See figure 4.) Figure 4: U.S. semiconductor firms’ future investments in R&D, by decoupling scenario [20] The robust U.S. semiconductor industry provides hundreds of thousands of jobs to the U.S. economy while simultaneously supporting downstream job creation in other sectors. For instance, a semiconductor process engineer position is one job in the economy, but it also indirectly supports logistics providers who ship the chips the engineer helps produce. Moreover, when the engineer spends their money in the economy, this further supports other jobs. For example, engineers support restaurant employees when they spend money at a restaurant. Indeed, as SIA’s 2025 Factbook highlights, a semiconductor industry job supports 5.7 additional downstream jobs in the U.S. economy. In 2024, the U.S. semiconductor industry supported approximately 345,000 direct jobs and indirectly supported nearly 2 million additional ones. However, when U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenues decline, they can no longer support as many industry jobs, leading to both direct and indirect job losses. Indeed, the U.S. semiconductor industry could support over 80,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 500,000 fewer downstream jobs if the United States fully decoupled from China. Meanwhile, the U.S. industry could support over 40,000 fewer industry jobs and more than 200,000 fewer downstream jobs in a scenario of 50 percent decoupling. A 25 percent decoupling could lead to about 20,000 fewer industry jobs and over 100,000 fewer downstream jobs. Finally, an export control entity listing could lead to over 8,000 fewer industry jobs and almost 50,000 fewer downstream jobs. (See figure 5.) In sum, significant export controls or decoupling with China could negatively impact U.S. households from decreased employment opportunities in well-paying high-tech jobs. Figure 5: U.S. semiconductor and additional job losses by decoupling scenario [21] The following section first examines the U.S. and Chinese global semiconductor market shares and revenues five years after a one-time full decoupling scenario. Afterward, it quantifies how a one-time full decoupling would negatively impact R&D investments in subsequent years, before examining the foregone jobs. If normal growth trajectories had prevailed (e.g., expected growth of China’s semiconductor market and stable U.S. market share) then after five years under a normal scenario, U.S. semiconductor companies could have been expected to earn about $84 billion from China’s market. With those revenues now lost in this full decoupling scenario, the sales would likely be accrued by other nations’ semiconductor firms. Chinese firms could gain about $10 billion, EU firms $17 billion, South Korean firms $22 billion, Japanese firms $13 billion, Taiwanese firms $15 billion, and other nations’ firms $6 billion. (See table 4.) Table 4: Foreign firms’ potential gains from U.S. firms’ losses five years after full decoupling (billions) [22] Product Type United States Mainland China Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Others Logic -$28.6 $4.1 $3.3 $9.0 $7.4 $2.5 $2.5 Memory -$21.9 $0.9 $2.0 $1.2 $0.1 $17.5 $0.1 Analog -$10.6 $1.6 $3.2 $0.9 $3.0 $0.7 $1.1 MPU -$7.2 $1.0 $0.8 $2.3 $1.8 $0.6 $0.6 Opto -$5.4 $0.8 $1.7 $0.5 $1.6 $0.4 $0.6 Discretes -$4.1 $0.6 $1.3 $0.3 $1.2 $0.3 $0.4 MCU -$2.9 $0.4 $0.3 $0.9 $0.7 $0.2 $0.2 Sensor -$2.5 $0.4 $0.8 $0.2 $0.7 $0.2 $0.3 DSP -$0.4 $0.1 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.0 Total -$83.6 $9.9 $13.4 $15.4 $16.7 $22.4 $5.8 As a result of the revenue reduction, U.S. firms’ global market share would be lower than without decoupling after five years. Without decoupling, the U.S. semiconductor industry’s global revenue could be about $396 billion, or a market share of 48 percent. In comparison, with full decoupling, the U.S. industry’s market share would likely fall to about 38 percent, equating to about $313 billion in revenue. (See figure 6.) Figure 6: U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [23] In contrast, Chinese semiconductor firms could gain some of U.S. firms’ lost revenue and grow their overall global revenue and market share. Without decoupling, Chinese firms’ global revenue could be about $52 billion, or about 6.3 percent. However, with full decoupling, Chinese firms’ global revenue could grow to about $62 billion (about 7 percent) after five years, approximately $10 billion higher than without decoupling. (See figure 7.) Figure 7: Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share five years after full decoupling [24] Due to the lower-than-expected revenue, U.S. firms’ R&D investments after five years would be smaller than with no decoupling. Without decoupling, U.S. firms would likely invest about $72 billion in R&D investments. Yet, U.S. firms could reduce their investments to about $57 billion under full decoupling, leading to $15 billion in foregone R&D investments. (See figure 8.) Figure 8: U.S. semiconductor firms’ investment in R&D five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [25] U.S. semiconductor firms’ lower-than-expected revenue also means that they would be able to support fewer industry and downstream jobs in the economy. Under the status quo scenario, the U.S. semiconductor industry could support about 400,000 industry jobs and 2.3 million downstream jobs. However, under full decoupling, U.S. firms could only support about 300,000 industry jobs and 1.8 million downstream jobs, leading to almost 100,000 foregone industry jobs and over 550,000 foregone downstream jobs. (See figure 9.) Figure 9: U.S. semiconductor and related jobs five years after full decoupling versus the status quo [26] In the medium term, U.S. firms would continue to forego revenue, R&D investments, and jobs in the event of any of the contemplated decoupling scenarios. Under 50 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $42 billion in revenue—resulting in a global market share of about 43 percent compared with 48 percent under the status quo—about $8 billion in R&D investments, about 50,000 industry jobs, and almost 300,000 downstream jobs after five years. Chinese firms could gain some of the U.S. firms’ losses, resulting in about a 7 percent global market share rather than 6 percent under the status quo. Under a 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms would forego about $21 billion in revenue, $4 billion in R&D investments, almost 25,000 industry jobs and about 140,000 downstream jobs. U.S. firms’ global market share could fall to about 45 percent, while Chinese firms’ share could rise to about 7 percent. Under an Entity List scenario, U.S. firms could still forego about $8 billion in revenue, $2 billion in R&D, almost 10,000 industry jobs, and over 56,000 downstream jobs—U.S. firms’ global market share could fall to 47 percent while Chinese firms’ share could rise to 6 percent. (See table 5.)

Then, it examines the impact on U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market, U.S. firms’ R&D investments, and U.S. industry and downstream jobs. Over the long run, the missing supply of semiconductors otherwise provided by U.S. firms to the Chinese market would be gained by foreign competitors, especially by China’s domestic semiconductor industry. As a result, these countries’ firms would have larger revenues to reinvest in R&D, accelerating their innovation capacity. Moreover, Chinese and other nations’ firms could steadily close the technological gap with the United States. In contrast, U.S. firms, constrained by smaller markets and diminished R&D capacity, could risk falling behind. This erosion of leadership could undermine the U.S. semiconductor industry’s central role in sustaining national competitiveness and technological primacy. ITIF estimates that, if current growth trends had prevailed and there had been no decoupling, U.S. semiconductor companies could have likely earned about $91 billion in revenues from the Chinese market 10 years from now. Again, those revenues are lost in this full decoupling scenario and instead would be accrued by firms from other nations. Here, ITIF estimates that South Korean firms could gain about $24 billion, EU firms $18 billion, and mainland Chinese firms $11 billion. Japan, Taiwan, and other nations could gain the remainder of the foregone revenue. (See table 6.) Table 6: Other nations’ gains and U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenue by semiconductor product type 10 years after full decoupling (billions) [28] Product Type United States Japan Taiwan EU South Korea Mainland China Others Logic -$31.2 $3.6 $9.8 $8.0 $2.7 $4.5 $2.7 Memory -$23.9 $2.2 $1.3 $0.2 $19.1 $1.0 $0.2 Analog -$11.5 $3.5 $1.0 $3.3 $0.8 $1.8 $1.2 MPU -$7.8 $0.9 $2.5 $2.0 $0.7 $1.1 $0.7 Opto -$5.9 $1.8 $0.5 $1.7 $0.4 $0.9 $0.6 Discretes -$4.5 $1.4 $0.4 $1.3 $0.3 $0.7 $0.5 MCU -$3.1 $0.4 $1.0 $0.8 $0.3 $0.4 $0.3 Sensor -$2.7 $0.8 $0.2 $0.8 $0.2 $0.4 $0.3 DSP -$0.4 $0.0 $0.1 $0.1 $0.0 $0.1 $0.0 Total -$91.1 $14.6 $16.7 $18.2 $24.4 $10.8 $6.3 Under the status quo, U.S. firms could maintain their global market share of 48 percent, which would result in about $520 billion in global revenues 10 years on. In contrast, under full decoupling, U.S. firms’ market share would likely drop to about 40 percent, resulting in about $429 billion of global revenue. (See figure 10.) Figure 10: U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [29] In comparison, Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share and revenue would be higher than no decoupling, as they would gain some of the U.S. firms’ lost revenue. Without decoupling, Chinese firms’ share could be about 6 percent, equating to a revenue of about $68 billion. Yet, with full decoupling, Chinese firms’ revenue could rise to $79 billion, leading to about a 7 percent global market share and about $11 billion more than if the United States does not fully decouple from China. (See figure 11.) Figure 11: Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share after full decoupling versus the status quo [30] As a result of the foregone revenue, U.S. firms would invest less in R&D compared with no decoupling. Under the status quo scenario, U.S. firms could invest about $95 billion in R&D in the 10th year. In comparison, under full decoupling, U.S. firms could invest only about $78 billion, resulting in about $17 billion of foregone R&D investments. (See figure 12.) Figure 12: U.S. semiconductor firms’ investment in R&D 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [31] Moreover, U.S. semiconductor firms would support fewer jobs. Under a status quo growth scenario, the U.S. semiconductor industry could likely support about 500,000 industry jobs and 2.8 million downstream jobs in the U.S. economy in 10 years’ time. But in a full decoupling scenario, after 10 years, U.S. firms would only be able to support about 370,000 industry jobs and 2.1 million downstream jobs, foregoing almost 120,000 industry jobs and over 650,000 downstream jobs. (See figure 13.) Figure 13: U.S. semiconductor jobs and additional jobs 10 years after full decoupling versus the status quo [32] In the long term, regardless of the extent of decoupling, U.S. firms could lose more than they gain. Accordingly, under 50 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $46 billion in revenue, $8 billion in R&D investments, almost 60,000 industry jobs, and over 300,000 downstream jobs 10 years after the initial decoupling. As a result, U.S. firms’ market share could be about 44 percent compared to about 48 percent without decoupling, while Chinese firms’ share could be about 7 percent compared with 6 percent without decoupling. Under 25 percent decoupling, U.S. firms could forego about $23 billion in revenue, $4 billion in R&D investments, almost 30,000 industry jobs, and almost 170,000 downstream jobs. Under an Entity List scenario, U.S. firms could still forego about $9 billion in revenue, $2 billion in R&D investments, over 10,000 industry jobs, and almost 70,000 downstream jobs. (See table 7.)

Advanced chips represent the backbone of modern ICT infrastructure, powering everything from data centers and cloud computing platforms to AI systems and high-performance computing applications. Indeed, as an ITIF report estimates, an average data center relies on approximately 340,000 semiconductors to function. [34] These chips enable efficiency in processing speed, energy efficiency, and data handling capabilities, which are essential for the evolving demands of the digital economy. However, in the consistently evolving ICT sector, which requires greater efficiency every day, the U.S. semiconductor industry needs to consistently innovate and develop the next generation of chips in order to keep up with customer demand. As this report explains, the U.S. semiconductor industry’s ability to innovate could be hindered due to export controls or decoupling with China by depriving the industry of the revenues necessary to finance the R&D needed to produce the next generation of innovative chips. Corroborating this, a BCG study estimates that a technology decoupling between the U.S. semiconductor industry and China would lead to a decline of $12 billion, or 30 percent, in R&D investment. [35] While other countries’ semiconductor firms could eventually supply advanced chips, it would take significant time for them to catch up to the already sophisticated designs and capabilities of U.S. firms. [36] During that period, U.S. industries would face higher costs, limited access to cutting-edge technology, and reduced competitiveness. Below are five examples of ICT industries that would be negatively affected by decreasing R&D in the semiconductor industry: 1. Cloud computing and data centers. Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud rely on high-performance chips to run large-scale data centers efficiently. Less-efficient semiconductors increase energy costs and reduce processing speed, limiting the ability to offer faster, cheaper, and more scalable cloud services. 2. AI and machine learning. AI systems, including natural language processing and computer vision, require advanced GPUs and AI accelerators. Slower or less-efficient chips reduce the speed of model training and inference, thereby constraining innovation and the adoption of AI tools across various industries. 3. Telecommunications and 5G networks. Next-generation 5G infrastructure depends on powerful chips to handle massive amounts of data with low latency. Reduced chip performance can slow network deployment, limit bandwidth, and degrade service quality for consumers and enterprises. Although national security concerns are very important, strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector’s leadership in the global market. 4. Enterprise software and high-performance computing (HPC). Applications such as financial modeling, scientific simulations, and big data analytics rely on fast, energy-efficient processors. Less-capable semiconductors increase computation time and costs, lowering productivity and innovation potential for these industries. 5. Consumer electronics and smart devices. Smartphones, laptops, smart home devices, and wearables depend on efficient semiconductors for battery life, speed, and advanced features. Reduced R&D in next-generation chips could delay product innovation, increase costs, and make U.S. products less competitive globally. The U.S. ICT sector’s reliance on advanced semiconductor technology necessitates continuous investment in R&D. Export controls and other measures that restrict market access could impede the development of next-generation chips, potentially hindering the growth and competitiveness of this critical industry. Policymakers should consider the long-term implications of such policies on semiconductor innovation and the broader digital economy. Although national security concerns are very important, strategic approaches that balance these concerns with the need for technological advancement are essential to sustain the U.S. ICT sector’s leadership in the global market. U.S. semiconductor export controls or broader decoupling from China would weaken the U.S. semiconductor industry and the wider economy. Limiting market access would reduce revenue for U.S. chipmakers, which would directly constrain their ability to fund R&D. Reduced R&D activity would hinder the creation of next-generation semiconductors, technologies that power critical ICT sectors such as cloud computing, AI, telecommunications, and high-performance computing. Reduced innovation in semiconductors cascades through these downstream industries, slowing technological advancement and weakening the global competitiveness of U.S. ICT firms. Lower revenue in the semiconductor industry would also force U.S. semiconductor companies to cut jobs, as they would be unable to maintain the same workforce without sufficient financial resources. Since each semiconductor job supports additional employment across the economy, the contraction in industry jobs would also reduce broader U.S. employment and economic activity. The U.S. semiconductor industry needs to continue to maintain its share of the Chinese semiconductor market in order to sustain ongoing R&D investment, which helps it maintain leadership in the industry and enables the United States to maintain its leadership in the digital economy. As such, U.S. policymakers should keep semiconductor export controls to a minimum in order to enable U.S. semiconductor firms to obtain high levels of revenue to invest in R&D. To estimate the impact of export controls or a decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor companies, ITIF first obtained the revenue of the global semiconductor market in 2024; China’s aggregate global demand and its market share; U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from the Chinese market; U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share and revenue; and Chinese semiconductor firms’ global share and revenue for our baseline assumptions. (See table 8.) These values come from SIA’s publications. Table 8: Economic model’s key variables and descriptions Variable Description Global semiconductor market Size of the global semiconductor market China’s demand of global market China’s portion of global demand U.S. firms’ share of China market Estimated share of China’s market held by U.S. firms U.S. firms’ global market share U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share Chinese firms’ global market share Chinese semiconductor firms’ global market share Using SIA’s 2025 Factbook, ITIF then obtained global semiconductor sales by type of product (e.g., logic, memory, etc.) . [37] We then estimated the total global semiconductor market for each type of semiconductor product. Assuming that the Chinese market demands the same share of each type of semiconductor product, China’s demand for each type of product in the global semiconductor market was estimated. Using U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of China’s market, ITIF also estimated U.S. firms’ revenue from the Chinese market for each type of product. These estimates were done for four different decoupling or export control scenarios: full decoupling (100 percent reduction in Chinese market access to U.S. semi), 50 percent decoupling (50 percent reduction), 25 percent decoupling (25 percent reduction), and Entity List (assuming Entity List only reduces U.S. semiconductor revenue from the Chinese market by 10 percent). (See table 9.) To simplify the analysis, ITIF assumed that U.S. firms have the same proportion of the Chinese market for all product types (though, obviously, this varies). Table 9: Economic model’s decoupling scenarios and U.S. firms’ share loss of Chinese market Decoupling Scenario U.S. Firms’ Share of Chinese Market Losses Full decoupling 100 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Considerable decoupling 50 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Partial decoupling 25 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Entity List 10 percent loss of revenue from the Chinese market Next, ITIF used data from BCG and SIA’s “Emerging Resilience in the Semiconductor Supply Chain” report to obtain the global semiconductor market share that China, the EU, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, and others hold for each semiconductor product type. [38] Logic semiconductor product types include general purpose logic chips, microprocessor unit chips (MPUs), microcontroller unit chips (MCUs), and digital signal processor chips (DSPs). Memory semiconductor product types only include memory chips. Discrete, analog, and optoelectronics (DAO) semiconductor product types include analog chips, optoelectronic (opto), discretes, and sensors. (See table 10.) With these observations, ITIF reduced the United States’ share and scaled the remaining nation’s share proportionally to 100 percent. In other words, the remaining nations are assumed to have taken over the United States’ shares based on their starting proportions (not including the United States). Table 10: Semiconductor product categories and product types for each category Logic Memory DAO ▪ General purpose logic chips ▪ Microprocessor units ▪ Microcontroller units ▪ Digital signal processor chips ▪ Memory chips ▪ Analog chips ▪ Optoelectronic chips ▪ Discretes ▪ Sensors Using the scaled shares of the remaining nations (not including the United States) and the U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market for each type of product, ITIF obtained the redistribution of the U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market to these remaining nations for each product type. This process was completed for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue losses on R&D investments for the four decoupling scenarios, ITIF first obtained the share of sales invested in R&D for U.S. firms and their corresponding value in 2024. Then, for each decoupling scenario, ITIF subtracted the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss from the 2024 U.S. semiconductor industry’s revenue before taking the share of sales invested in R&D for U.S. firms. We then subtracted this value from U.S. semiconductor firms’ original R&D spending in 2024 to obtain the potential foregone R&D investment. To estimate the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue losses on the semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first obtained the total number of semiconductor industry employees in 2024. Then U.S. firms’ revenue per employee was used to estimate job losses. Since it was not possible to determine the elasticity of demand for semiconductor firm’s employees, this model assumes a linear relationship between chipmakers’ employment demand and revenues. ITIF first obtained the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue per employee by dividing the U.S. semiconductor firms’ global revenue by the number of employees. Next, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss for each decoupling scenario was divided by the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue per employee to obtain the number of employees foregone from the decline in revenue. To assess the impact of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue loss on non-semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first determined the semiconductor job multiplier in 2024, which was estimated to be 5.7. [39] This means every job in the semiconductor industry generated 5.7 additional jobs in the U.S. economy. Next, the number of foregone semiconductor jobs was multiplied by 5.7 to determine the number of foregone downstream jobs. To estimate U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue foregone from decoupling with China after 5 and 10 years, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate of U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue from the Chinese market from 2020 to 2024. Then, for each decoupling scenario, ITIF took U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each semiconductor product and multiplied it by (1 + the average annual growth rate) raised to the power of 5 or 10 (years) to determine the U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenues 5 and 10 years after decoupling. Moreover, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses that were shifted to other nations were also multiplied by the average annual growth rate to estimate how much each nation gained after 5 and 10 years from U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses from decoupling in the base year. This was done for each decoupling scenario and each semiconductor type. To determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone R&D investments, ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales invested in R&D (i.e., R&D intensity) by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024. The rate was then multiplied by U.S. semiconductor firms’ foregone revenue after 5 and 10 years for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the foregone semiconductor jobs from decoupling in the base year, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor jobs. Then the number of jobs lost after decoupling in the base year was multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate). This was done for each decoupling scenario. To determine the additional jobs in the economy foregone, ITIF multiplied these values by the job multiplier (5.7). This was done for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of decoupling after 5 and 10 years, ITIF first obtained the average annual growth rate for the global semiconductor market from 2005 to 2024 and U.S. firms’ revenue from China’s market from 2020 to 2024. ITIF also obtained the average China market demand of the global market, U.S. firms’ global market share, and Chinese firms’ global market share from 2015 to 2024. Using the growth rates, ITIF first estimated the new global semiconductor market after 5 and 10 years. It was then assumed that China’s demand of the global market would continue to be the average of its last 10 years. Next, the new demand was multiplied by the new global semiconductor market value to determine the revenue from China’s demand of the global market. Then, ITIF estimated U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of and revenue from China’s market for each decoupling scenario after 5 and 10 years. To do so, U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each decoupling scenario were first subtracted from the U.S. semiconductor firms’ revenue from the China market in Year 0 before decoupling to determine the remaining Chinese market that U.S. semiconductor firms retained after decoupling in Year 0. That value was then multiplied by (1 + the annual average growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) for 5 or 10 years after decoupling to determine the new revenue from the Chinese market for U.S. firms. These values were divided by China’s demand of the global market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ share of China’s market. Next, the U.S. semiconductor firms’ global market share was estimated. To do so, the average U.S. firms’ market share in the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor market to determine U.S. firms’ new global revenue. With that value, ITIF subtracted U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) raised to 5 or 10 (years). These values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine U.S. semiconductor firms’ market share. ITIF also estimated China’s market share 5 and 10 years after decoupling. To calculate this, the average Chinese firm’s market share over the last 10 years was first multiplied by the global semiconductor revenue to determine the new global revenue of Chinese firms. With that value, ITIF added the U.S. semiconductor firms’ losses that were gained by Chinese firms for each decoupling scenario in Year 0 multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate of U.S. firms’ revenue from the China market) raised to 5 or 10 (years). Then, these values were divided by the total global semiconductor market to determine Chinese firms’ market share. To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor firms’ R&D spending, ITIF first estimated the average annual share of sales spent on R&D by U.S. semiconductor firms from 2015 to 2024. That average was then multiplied by the new U.S. global market share to determine U.S. firms’ new R&D amount 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling. This was done for each decoupling scenario. To estimate the impact of decoupling with China on U.S. semiconductor industry jobs, ITIF first estimated the average annual growth rate from 2015 to 2024 for U.S. semiconductor firms’ total employees. Next, the total number of U.S. semiconductor firms’ employees in year 0 after decoupling was estimated by subtracting U.S. semiconductor firms’ job losses from each decoupling scenario from the U.S. semiconductor firms’ total employees before decoupling in year 0. These values were then multiplied by (1 + the average annual growth rate) raised to the power of 5 or 10 (years) to determine the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling. To estimate the additional jobs created 5 and 10 years after an initial decoupling, ITIF first assumed the job multiplier did not change. Then, the new number of semiconductor industry employees 5 and 10 years after decoupling was multiplied by the job multiplier for each decoupling scenario.

ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy. ITIF urges the U.S. government to renew the USMCA . The USMCA strengthens America’s position to compete with China. First, it enables U.S. manufacturers to source inputs from Canada and Mexico at lower cost, as USMCA-qualifying goods—those meeting the agreement’s rules-of-origin (ROO) thresholds—move tariff-free across the region. Second, it helps weaken China’s manufacturing capacity by incentivizing firms to reshore production to North America and substitute Chinese imports with inputs or final products made within the region. The renewal of the USMCA should be conditioned on Mexico’s full compliance with its intellectual property (IP) commitments under the current agreement. USMCA renewal should reflect a modernized version of the existing agreement . First, the new agreement needs concrete rules to shield the USMCA regional economy from Chinese predatory practices , including strengthening rules of origin rules and enforcement, implementing more commonly standardized investment screening practices, and allowing mechanisms to exclude IP mass infringers from the North American economy. Second, USMCA countries should jointly establish common goals to improve the region’s competitiveness . Third, the current digital trade chapter should be modernized to include provisions on adopting emerging technologies and facilitating digital governance—for example, e-payments—and to address topics that currently define the North American digital economy, such as hardware and export controls. Fourth, the agreement should continue to strengthen the rules underpinning IP rights throughout the region, particularly in the life sciences. This submission also incorporates suggestions on what USMCA countries should not do to compromise or undermine the USMCA : misleadingly promote “digital sovereignty” principles and expand tariff escalation to USMCA-qualifying goods. Lastly, if the United States is to take the USMCA seriously, it must advocate for and itself embrace a tariff-free trading environment in North America. The U.S. government should take the lead and urge Canada and Mexico to continue the USMCA. According to its original text, if the 2026 review of the agreement leads to renewal, USMCA shall continue in force for 16 years, with a review in 2032. Alongside renewing the USMCA, the U.S. government should consider starting negotiations to expand the USMCA to other economies in the Americas that can complement U.S. capabilities. Key candidates include existing bilateral free trade partners—Chile, Colombia, Panama, and Peru—as well as countries in the Dominican Republic-Central America FTA (CAFTA-DR) with high-tech production capabilities (especially Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic). The United States should make the development of a competitive North American Production System—a “factory North America”—the top priority. A stronger North American production system enhances U.S. techno-economic power by expanding regional manufacturing capacity and reducing dependence on China through reshoring and shifting trade flows from it. The three neighbors should work together to proactively support a North American production system, as investments, research and development (R&D), and trade among these countries are more likely to benefit others in North America than production networks based in China. However, for this to happen, especially in manufactured and advanced technology products, the United States needs to stop including Mexico and Canada in discriminatory domestic requirements (such as with steel tariffs and Buy American provisions). The United States also needs to stop reflexively opposing U.S. firms that move or increase production in Mexico. That’s because production in Mexico is fundamentally different from that in China. For example, 40 percent of the inputs to finished manufactured goods in Mexico come from the United States. [1] By contrast, for China, that figure is a mere 4 percent. In essence, unlike trade with Mexico (and Canada), when production goes to China, the United States loses out on much more of the production process and interlinkages, not to mention enabling a potent adversary. Indeed, one of the greatest strengths of NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement, the preceding trilateral agreement) and USMCA has been the creation of continentally integrated markets and production networks, particularly for sectors such as autos, where parts and components may cross the borders of North American countries as many as eight times before being installed in a final assembly plant. [2] Similarly, medical devices cross North American borders many times as they are refined toward final production. [3] The USMCA strengthens North America’s ability to leverage its complementary supply chain advantages. For example, while the United States depends on Mexico for a lower-cost production environment, Mexican firms source many inputs from U.S. firms, as evidenced by robust intra-industry trade surpluses. For example, a 2019 ITIF report found that, in trade with Mexico, tech-based industries accounted for 42 percent of gross exports and 56 percent of gross imports, and 45 percent of value-added exports and 49 percent of value-added imports. [4] These figures show that exports to Mexico are more tech-based and imports are less tech-based (i.e., complex and R&D-intensive) than gross values suggest. In general, trade with Mexico is less tech-based, but the United States relies on Mexican production facilities in large part to supply consumers with cheap tech-based products. Canada complements the United States’ lead role in knowledge-intensive and value-added manufacturing. However, looking ahead, Canada can specialize in the mining and processing of the critical minerals needed in many advanced technologies, such as electric vehicles (EVs). Canada also brings distinct strengths in the aerospace, quantum, and ICT services sectors, and Mexico is growing in sectors such as ICT manufacturing and services and automotive supply. The United States is much better positioned to compete globally against China if the USMCA is treated as a single economic bloc . Indeed, the United States needs to promote a “Factory North America” if it—and the region—is to effectively compete with China. Figure 1 shows the relative size of the economies of China, the United States, and the USMCA compared to the global economy since 2000. While the United States experienced a relative decline during the first two decades of the century, China has rapidly expanded its global economic influence, growing from less than 3 percent of the global economy in 2000 to over 17 percent in 2020. By the end of the decade, China is projected to close the gap in its share of the global economy with the United States to just 2.5 percentage points. Policymakers need to acknowledge that the United States is in an industrial war against the People’s Republic of China (PRC)—and America is not winning . [5] Figure 1: Gross domestic product as a share of the total global (estimates for 2025–2030) [6] China has already surpassed the United States in production in many strategic sectors, but the gap is much narrower considering the USMCA economic bloc . To measure how economies’ manufacturing capacity in strategic sectors has evolved relative to one another, ITIF created the Hamilton Index. [7] The index measures changes in countries’ global share of value-added output across 10 advanced-industry sectors: pharmaceuticals; electrical equipment; machinery and equipment; motor vehicle equipment; other transport equipment; computer, electronic, and optical products; information technology and information services; chemicals (not including pharmaceuticals); basic metals; and fabricated metals. [8] The sectors covered in the Hamilton Index together accounted for nearly $12 trillion in global production in 2022—the last year with available data—representing over 11 percent of the world’s economy. Figure 2 summarizes China’s, the United States’s, and the USMCA countries’ share of output in Hamilton industries from 1995 to 2022. China’s global share of output in these industries has quintupled over that timeframe, rising to 22 percent, 3.1 percent higher than the U.S. share—however, counting USMCA, this gap is reduced to only 0.3 percentage points. Figure 2: Historical shares of global output in Hamilton industries (1995–2022) [9] At the sectoral level, the USMCA’s economic bloc can help narrow the gap with China’s output in strategic industries (or expand it) by at least six percentage points. Figure 3 shows the differences between China’s output by sector and the United States, and between the USMCA’s economic bloc and the United States. Canada and Mexico, on average across sectors, represent 6 percent of Chinese production in strategic industries. There are three sectors in which the contribution of these two economies exceeds 24 percent of China’s output: motor vehicles, other transportation, and IT and information services. In contrast, China’s output in 7 of 10 strategic sectors exceeds that of the United States or the USMCA economic bloc—the North American economies lead only in pharmaceuticals, other transportation, and IT and information services. Figure 3: How the USMCA economic bloc closes the gap with China in Hamilton industries (percentage points of difference in output) [10] This section provides examples of how the USMCA is benefiting American companies competing in Hamilton industries. U.S. companies benefit from the certainty provided by USMCA, which ensures that USMCA-qualifying products won’t be subject to tariffs—and from the overarching rules-based stability it provides, ensuring fair and non-discriminatory competition. Beyond these cases, it’s worth noting that the uncertainty around USMCA renewal is itself curtailing investment that could further benefit U.S. companies. [11] Micron Technologies, an American semiconductor company based in Idaho, has leveraged USMCA’s efficiency gains to develop a more resilient supply chain. For example, in 2024, it announced a new semiconductor assembly and R&D center in Guadalajara, Mexico, to complement its U.S. operations and reduce its reliance on China. [12] Timely, this investment has helped the company remain resilient against Chinese predatory practices, as Micron reportedly exited the server chip market in China in October 2025 following a Chinese government ban. [13] The 5.0-liter V8 engines of the Ford F-150 and Ford Mustang are produced in Ontario, Canada, while the final product requires crossing the U.S.-Canada border “five or six times.” [14] The Ford F-150 has been the most popular vehicle sold in the United States for over four decades. It is assembled in Michigan or Missouri, with nearly 45 percent of its parts coming from Canada or the United States, and a significant share of the remainder manufactured in Mexico. [15] Chapter 14 of the USCMA addresses investments, but it needs to be reformed to establish coordination mechanisms to prevent Chinese investment in strategic industries. ITIF has recently reported how Chinese electric vehicle makers have benefited from aggressive state-sponsored mercantilist policies and explained why they should not be allowed to manufacture in the United States. [16] The USMCA should create mechanisms that allow the United States to coordinate the screening of foreign direct investment (FDI) in North America, providing it with the tools to identify and potentially ban predatory investments in the region and to prevent products such as Chinese EVs from entering the U.S. market. In addition, a reformed Chapter 14 should outline mechanisms to share information on foreign investment screening from “countries of concern,” with clear objectives, responsibilities, and a mandate to report to the three partners. Rules of Origin (ROOs) define where a product is made, which is not always straightforward. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) considers a product made in a certain country if its inputs undergo a “substantial transformation”—a definition heavily contested. For example, CBP issues over 50 ROO rulings annually just for Canada and Mexico. [17] By improving ROO standards under the USMCA, the United States can prevent Chinese inputs from entering Canada and Mexico’s supply chains and the final products derived from them from entering the U.S. market unwantedly. USMCA-qualifying products are defined by regional content production, not by a firm’s nationality. Thus, a Chinese company investing in North America is treated the same as any other and is given potential tariff-free access to the U.S. market. This ignores the mercantilist nature of the Chinese economy—any company competing against Chinese peers faces potentially significant disadvantages, since the latter often receive numerous forms of support from China’s innovation mercantilist strategy (e.g., massive subsidies, extensive IP theft, barriers to Chinese firms competing in China’s market, etc.) While the United States has tools to prevent the entry of Chinese products benefitting from mercantilist practices—such as antidumping, countervailing duties, targeted tariffs, or market exclusion (e.g. if a product were found to be infringing a U.S. owner’s IP rights in a Section 337 case), the USMCA itself should contain rules that help prevent Chinese companies benefitting from mercantilist policies from getting their final products (or even inputs) into the U.S. market. The USMCA should raise thresholds for what is considered locally produced in the region to qualify as a USMCA product if the production is derived from Chinese FDI. The current USMCA ROOs define thresholds based on what is produced within North America (i.e., regional value content, or RVC). USMCA’s ROO thresholds vary by product and industry, and any potential change to the rule should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. However, USMCA’s ROOs are neutral regarding the firm’s ownership. A renewed USMCA should include additional thresholds for products manufactured in North America by Chinese-owned companies. In addition, there are reports that the enforcement of ROOs needs improvement. [18] ROO enforcement can be improved by expanding oversight funding and implementing real-time verification of supply chain data and regional content. This would require an explicit and binding commitment from all trade partners. Canada and Mexico should not negotiate trade deals with China unilaterally. The current USMCA (article 32.10) includes a clause that allows countries to terminate the agreement if another party signs a free trade agreement (FTA) with a non-market country, including China. This safeguard should cover all trade deals and arrangements, not just full FTAs, to prevent USMCA partners from entering into any trade arrangement with a non-market country—particularly China—without prior consultation and alignment with the other partners. Revising this clause would prevent, for example, Canada’s reported consideration of lifting its 100 percent tariffs on Chinese EVs, which could undermine North America’s auto industry. [19] The Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) chapter of a renewed USMCA should include commitments that USMCA members update their domestic legislation to exclude companies from countries of concern that are frequent or blatant IPR infringers from their markets. ITIF has proposed that USTR support ongoing discussions in Congress about amending the Tariff Act of 1930 to enable stronger use of the U.S. International Trade Commission’s (USITC) Section 337 statute to make it easier to exclude goods and services from China supported by systemically unfair trade practices. [20] Section 337 allows the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate foreign companies’ unfair trade practices, often involving IP infringement and antitrust violations, to impose remedies such as banning infringing products from entering the U.S. market. This legislation was designed to address and enforce laws against infringing companies, imposing restrictions on specific goods. However, legislators did not consider that an entire national economy could be an infringer, making the tool insufficient and outdated. Further, Section 337 does not address other unfair predatory practices widely used by the Chinese government, such as forced technology transfers, closed domestic markets, massive industrial subsidies, or soft loans. U.S. policymakers need to differentiate between the significant economic benefits the U.S. economy derives from U.S. firms setting up operations in Mexico (and Canada) versus China. U.S. firms depend on global operations in places like Mexico to remain competitive, and often the choice is not between the United States and Mexico as production locations, but between Mexico and China. [21] In addition, a strategy of reshoring production from China to Mexico can help the United States weaken the Chinese manufacturing economy, while helping America’s, as spillovers and agglomeration effects can benefit U.S. manufacturing. The current Competitiveness chapter (chapter 26) establishes the USMCA Competitiveness Committee (the Committee). [22] However, the objectives of this Committee are not narrowly defined, and practically any aspect of the North American economy falls within its scope. The Committee should explicitly seek to boost the competitiveness of the region’s strategic industries. To do so, it should include: ▪ Explicit definitions of its members and annual goals. A renewed USMCA should explicitly designate one agency per country responsible for competitiveness and productivity, with the head serving as the representative on the Committee. The agreement should also explicitly require the Committee to focus on strategic sectors—three at a time—narrowing the action plan to develop coordination mechanisms, metrics and joint analytics, and measurable objectives to improve the competitiveness of these sectors within three years. The first sectors to target should be autos, information and communication technologies (ICT), and base metals and critical minerals. ▪ Improve and standardize how USMCA members collect, share, and publish competitiveness data. The Committee should proactively publish updated information on trade and investment facilitated by USMCA rules. The Committee should also identify important sub-national metrics that are not currently collected or shared publicly among USMCA partners, and collaborate with each country and region to develop these indicators. [23] For example, policymakers would benefit from detailed firm-level information on the use of USMCA products as intermediate goods, the intensity of highly qualified personnel, cross-border research efforts, and the adoption and absorption of digital technologies. ▪ The Committee should jointly develop annual recommendations for each party to improve competitiveness. In other words, the Committee should, each year, prepare a brief policy document for each country that contains recommendations to improve the three countries’ competitiveness. These recommendations should be publicly available, contain measurable objectives, and each year’s report should account for which previous recommendations were considered. ▪ Develop a North American manufacturing digitalization strategy and ecosystem. USMCA partners should launch a coordinated strategy to accelerate the digital transformation of North American manufacturing. A jointly funded initiative should support the creation of a regional digital-manufacturing ecosystem, with companion institutes in Canada and Mexico linked through formal cooperation channels. Alternatively, the governments could sign a memorandum of understanding allowing Canadian and Mexican firms and agencies to co-fund and participate in projects at the U.S. Digital Manufacturing and Cybersecurity Institute (MxD), one of the 18 innovation institutes in the Manufacturing USA network. This collaboration would foster a cross-border innovation hub to share tools, software, standards, and workforce skills (particularly for small and medium enterprises) and scale the adoption of advanced digital manufacturing production technologies across the region. The USMCA was a pioneering agreement toward advancing digital trade rules worldwide. At the time the agreement entered force in 2020, it contained the strongest commitments on digital trade rules of any international agreement. The USMCA’s robust digital rules remain in place; however, after five years, other countries have signed agreements related to the digital economy with novel approaches. [24] (See appendices.) U.S. policymakers should review these to identify new approaches to help keep the USMCA amongst the world’s leading digital-trade-promoting agreements. U.S. leadership in setting digital trade rules matters for several reasons. First, it safeguards America’s position at the forefront of the global digital economy. U.S. technology companies depend on open cross-border data flows, bans on data-localization mandates, protections for source code, and strong cybersecurity standards to scale internationally. These rules enable digital services companies to aggregate data, refine services, and stay globally competitive. [25] Second, they prevent other jurisdictions from imposing discriminatory measures that undermine innovation. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) designates so-called “gatekeepers,” a group of seven digital companies—of which five are American—selected based on revenue, market capitalization, and user base thresholds. [26] The DMA’s rules degrade users’ experiences due to anti-self-preferencing rules, decrease privacy and security by mandating interoperability, and adopt a “precautionary principle” approach that undermines innovation. [27] Europe has promoted its restrictive approach to digital markets regulation globally, trying to get other countries to implement DMA-like rules, in a phenomenon known as the “Brussels effect.” North American policymakers should explicitly reject this approach, and recognize that by operating under predictable, pro-innovation digital trade frameworks, U.S. tech firms can reinvest efficiency gains from global scale into research and development—fueling the next wave of technological leadership. [28] Third, the United States can gain a relative advantage in its strategic competition by leading in setting global digital trade rules. The underlying principles that set these rules reflect countries’ technological trajectories and priorities, and the expansion of these rules eases the adoption of these technologies worldwide. China aligns digital trade with principles that enable it to surveil its population in a relatively unrestricted manner and to set digital rules that facilitate the adoption of Chinese technologies overseas. [29] The differences between the U.S. and Chinese approaches are clear, such as in data localization rules—meaning, companies being forced to keep data within a country. Chinese firms can gain a competitive advantage from data localization because they are willing to comply with surveillance and censorship requests from foreign governments. In contrast, U.S. companies focus on efficiency and benefit from regional data centers, facilitated by cross-border data flows, that serve multiple markets. [30] These differences are reflected in how China shapes digital trade rules. China is leading trade initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, notably as a proponent of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). RCEP makes cross-border rules compatible with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) digital laws (e.g., Cybersecurity, Data Security, and Personal Information Protection Laws), permitting data localization rules under “essential security interests” excuses. [31] The United States should push for a modernization of the USMCA’s digital trade chapter with a clear focus on strengthening the competitiveness of American firms and enhancing regional digital governance. Updating the agreement would reinforce transparent, nondiscriminatory rules that preserve the scale and efficiency advantages of U.S. technology companies across the North America region. More detailed and flexible provisions on data governance, cybersecurity, and the responsible use of AI in government procurement would create a more predictable and innovation-friendly environment for U.S. cloud, software, and AI providers—crucial to the administration’s objective of exporting an American AI technology stack. [32] These changes would also bring Canada and Mexico closer into alignment with the U.S. vision for open, interoperable, and market-driven digital rules—helping curb the proliferation of restrictive “digital sovereignty” frameworks. ▪ The digital trade chapter should become a “digital economy and security chapter.” The nominal change should reflect a shift in understanding of what this chapter covers, modernizing it for the current era, as the global trade system is experiencing the most significant change since the post-war era. The chapter should cover all digital topics, including infrastructure and hardware, and include provisions and sanctions that ban the presence of adversaries in the North American telecommunications network (Huawei, for example, is widely used in Mexico). [33] The reframing from “trade” to “economy” should be understood as allowing the chapter to be part of the “DTA+” type of agreement, covering emerging topics such as AI. [34] Finally, including the security angle would allow U.S. policymakers to include export control alignment provisions, which are currently absent from the USMCA. ▪ Add provisions for pro-innovation emerging technology adoption rules. ITIF suggests considering the DEPA text as a template for the following topics: [35] – E-invoicing: “Each party shall ensure that the implementation of measures related to e-invoicing in its jurisdiction is designed to support cross-border interoperability. For that purpose, each party shall base its measures related to e-invoicing on international standards, guidelines, or recommendations, where they exist.” – E-payment: “Parties agree to support the development of efficient, safe and secure cross-border electronic payments by fostering the adoption and use of internationally accepted standards, promoting interoperability and the interlinking of payment infrastructures, and encouraging useful innovation and competition in the payments ecosystem.” “The Parties shall endeavour to take into account, for relevant payment systems, internationally accepted payment standards to enable greater interoperability between payment systems.” “The Parties agree that policies should promote innovation and competition in a level playing field and recognise the importance of enabling the introduction of new financial and electronic payment products and services by incumbents and new entrants in a timely manner such as through adopting regulatory and industry sandboxes.” – Digital ID: “Each party shall endeavour to promote the interoperability between their respective regimes for digital identities. This may include (…) comparable protection of digital identities afforded by each party’s respective legal frameworks, or the recognition of their legal and regulatory effects, whether accorded autonomously or by mutual agreement.” – Government Procurement: “The Parties recognise that the digital economy will have an impact on government procurement and affirm the importance of open, fair and transparent government procurement markets.” “To this end, the Parties shall undertake cooperation activities in relation to understanding how greater digitisation of procurement processes, and of goods and services impacts on existing and future international government procurement commitments.” – Data innovation: “The parties recognise that cross-border data flows and data sharing enable data-driven innovation. The parties further recognise that innovation may be enhanced within the context of regulatory data sandboxes where data, including personal information, is shared amongst businesses in accordance with the parties’ respective laws and regulations.” ▪ Incorporate provisions to avoid disproportionate and unfair policies targeting American companies. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of policies worldwide targeting U.S. technology companies (reported in the ITIF Big Tech Policy Tracker). [36] The USMCA fails to prevent these attacks on U.S. technology companies, mainly because the proliferation of policies targeting them occurred after the agreement entered into force. The causes of this proliferation are varied. For example, it is politically easier to capture rents from foreign companies than to implement a neutral and fair regulatory system. In addition, the U.S. government has made insufficient efforts to protect its companies overseas. A renewed USMCA should: – Avoid carve-outs to existing digital trade provisions that allow USMCA members to implement rent-seeking policies targeting U.S. firms. For example, the current digital trade chapter excludes all government procurement policies from its provisions. This makes it easier for policymakers to include data localization requirements and weakens protections for source code, among other irritants. – Include a provision explicitly banning digital service taxes (DST). Digital service taxes are levied on digitally delivered services, such as online marketplaces, advertising, social media platforms, and the sale of user data. DSTs typically impose taxes on the domestic revenue of multinational companies in a narrow range of business models, and include thresholds to exclude all but the largest firms. [37] DSTs represent a distortive tax that discriminates against a narrow set of companies and sectors, penalizes large companies, and unfairly punishes the same transactions depending on the platform on which they are made (e.g., an online purchase might be subject to the DST or not, based on whether the company meets the tax’s thresholds). [38] – Avoid online liability provisions that would involve changes in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Section 230 includes two main provisions: one that protects online services and users from liability when they do not remove third-party content, and one that protects them from liability when they do remove content. [39] This provision afforded legal protection to U.S. technology companies—allowing them to innovate, test new products and services, and maintain American leadership in the digital sector. Without this provision, online services would face substantial legal costs for third-party content, users and businesses would face higher costs for digitally delivered services, and some online services would risk shutting down or eliminating popular features. [40] The USMCA’s chapter 20 on intellectual property rights (IPRs) defines rules aligned with international standards, such as those defined by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). This chapter establishes provisions related to IPRs—for example, on patents, regulatory exclusivities, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, and industrial design—alongside enforcement mechanisms. USMCA’s IPR chapter represented a modernization of NAFTA’s by including, among other elements, a longer copyright term of life of the author plus 70 years, a mandate to provide patent term extension for unreasonable patent office delays, and a provision of full national treatment for copyright and related rights. [41] USTR should urge its Canadian and Mexican counterparts to improve their policies and enforcement of IPR protections. Despite the updated framework, Canada and Mexico are recurring infringers of IPRs. Both countries are listed on USTR’s 2025 “Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Protection and Enforcement” (the IP Watch List). Canada remains on this report due to poor enforcement of counterfeits at the border and allegations that pirated subscription services have been sold physically and online. Mexico is listed on the Priority Watch List, among a group of countries with “onerous or egregious acts, policies, or practices and whose acts, policies, or practices have the greatest adverse impact (actual or potential) on the relevant U.S. products.” [42] The main reason for including Mexico on this list is its unresolved USMCA commitments—especially the lack of action in investigating and prosecuting trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy, as well as the Attorney General’s failure to report IP enforcement statistics. Mexico also continues to provide weak protection of pharmaceutical IP and poor enforcement of IPRs online. [43] Concerningly, Mexico has failed to meet its USMCA obligation to provide patent term extensions that compensate for unreasonable delays in patent approval. [44] The USMCA requires members to ensure that pharmaceutical patent holders receive the full effective term of protection, even when administrative processes shorten it. Mexico’s four-and-a-half-year transitional period to implement this measure expired on January 1, 2025. In September 2025, Mexico’s president Claudia Sheinbaum submitted a law to fulfill Mexico’s USMCA commitments on IPR protection, although this still awaits passage. [45] U.S. policymakers should condition the renewal of the USMCA on Mexico fulfilling its current commitments within the first six months of 2026. Besides strengthening the enforcement of USMCA commitments, an updated IPR chapter should also include the following additions: ▪ Incorporate provisions protecting rightsholders from digital piracy by allowing modern, safe website blocking practices. Digital piracy represents a growing illegal business, costing American firms over $29 billion annually. [46] The most effective tool against digital piracy is allowing courts to issue injunctions to block piracy websites and their proxy sites—including foreign sites—as well as temporary blocks to protect live events. [47] The revised UMSCA should include a provision with these characteristics. Canada is the only USMCA country that has these mechanisms. Mexico allows for blocking piracy sites, but not its proxies or live events, and the United States does not allow blocking foreign piracy sites. ▪ Incorporate a provision establishing a minimum of 10 years of biologics data protection. A provision requiring regulatory data supporting new biologic drugs to be protected for at least 10 years was incorporated into the original USMCA text but later removed. [48] (House parliamentarians argued that it would increase the cost of medicines, yet without much supporting data.) [49] This was a mistake, and it needs to be amended. This provision is needed due to the distinct character of innovating biologic drugs. While patents constitute one important form of IP protection for biologics, they are not sufficient to support the environment needed to promote large-scale investment in biologic R&D, for two principal reasons. First, because biologics are structurally complex molecules which are closely tied to a specific manufacturing process, many biologic patents are process patents or relatively narrowly constructed product patents. This means that biologics patents are susceptible to being circumvented by small changes to the molecule or to the process of making it. [50] Because patents fail to provide the same certainty for biologics as they do for traditional pharmaceutical drugs, they do not necessarily assure that biologics will enjoy the same length of time on the market before facing competition from generics. Second, patents do not safeguard the intellectual property involved in developing the extensive clinical trial data and results required to prove the safety and efficacy of a biopharmaceutical product (e.g., the regulatory data). Recognizing the need to strike a balance between innovators’ incentives for investment in expensive and risky novel drug development while at the same time making room for competition by creating a path for biosimilar manufacturers to bring biosimilar products to market, the U.S. Congress enshrined in the bipartisan Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BCIPA) 12 years of data exclusivity protection for novel biologic medicines. This has helped unleash a flourishing of biologics innovation in the United States. Today, biologic medicines account for 40 percent of drugs under development. [51] Accordingly, if North America is to be the premier location in the world for developing the next generation of drugs for the benefit of humankind, then the USMCA should commit participating nations to providing at least 10 years of data exclusivity protection for biologic drugs. ▪ USMCA partners should adopt a robust patent- and exclusivity-linkage regime for biologics and other medicines, requiring regulators to verify active exclusivities on the reference product before authorizing generic product entry. Implementation should include early notice to rightsholders, a transparent patent/exclusivity register, regulator–IP office coordination, and a time-limited pre-launch stay to resolve disputes. This framework provides innovators with predictable recovery of high-risk R&D, prevents costly at-risk launches for generics, and blocks disruptive post-launch switches for patients. [52] USMCA partners should steer clear of the trap of promoting so-called “digital sovereignty” principles without considering their costs, practicality, or even clarifying what they mean by this notion . Authorities from all USMCA countries have supported initiatives that advocate for digital sovereignty principles. This narrative is misleading (it doesn’t achieve self-sufficiency goals), inefficient (it raises costs by creating rules that impede technology companies’ ability to scale), and discriminatory (it favors local companies over foreign competitors). For example, Canada’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney, announced in September 2025 that the Canadian government will support the development of a Canadian “sovereign cloud.” [53] His statement was framed as an attempt to “build compute capacity and data centers” to boost competitiveness, security, and independence, giving Canada an “independent control over advanced computing power.” [54] Under this framework, the government announced the Canadian Sovereign AI Compute Strategy, an agenda to attract private-sector investment, promote public digital infrastructure, and secure access to compute power, particularly for researchers. [55] While perhaps well-intentioned, the “cloud sovereignty” efforts by Canadian authorities represent a mix of data localization rules and subsidies for Canadian domestic cloud providers. These measures limit the efficiency of computing power by restricting it to a local rather than a global scale and do not truly provide “sovereignty” as generally understood—namely, reducing dependence on foreign technologies. Canada’s digital infrastructure will still rely on chip design and manufacturing, telecommunications networks, and hardware and software produced outside the country. Mexico has also embraced the rhetoric of “digital sovereignty.” In September 2025, president Sheinbaum announced the government’s goal of achieving “true technological independence” by 2045. [56] The accompanying strategy, however, primarily emphasizes capability building rather than isolation. The plan envisions that, by mid-century, Mexico will possess a “robust and redundant” digital infrastructure and emerge as a provider of open, interoperable, and transferable digital resources. [57] The government’s agenda centers on expanding Internet access, investing in digital infrastructure, deploying digital government services, and strengthening data protection frameworks. Similar to Canada’s approach, Mexico’s plan does not depend exclusively on domestic suppliers. Instead, it seeks to enhance national digital capabilities while maintaining engagement with global technology firms. The U.S. government has also fallen into this narrative. White House Technology Advisor Michael Kratsios announced in August 2025, during a multilateral meeting, that the United States wants trade partners to have “AI sovereignty, data privacy, and technical customization.” [58] Differing from Canada and Mexico’s cases, Kratsios was referring to “AI sovereignty as the ability of a nation to dictate the terms on which foreign AI operates within national borders,” rather than self-sufficiency or digital capabilities. [59] In general, countries should adopt a language and framework of “advancing their digital capabilities” rather than “trying to achieve digital sovereignty.” The former would do far more to advance countries’ innovative and productive capabilities by taking maximal advantage of the capabilities of modern digital technologies. So far, USMCA-qualifying goods have remained mostly out of the current administration’s trade war . Most products that qualify under USMCA rules of origin (ROOs) remain at 0 percent tariffs announced during the second Trump administration. This exempts over 90 percent of imports from Canada and 84 percent of imports from Mexico from the U.S. government’s tariffs. [60] The remaining goods from Canada are taxed at 35 percent, and those entering from Mexico are taxed at 25 percent (10 percent for potash). [61] However, the United States is imposing tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products that contain specific components, such as steel and aluminum. The Trump administration should not impose sectoral tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, especially for inputs and intermediate goods critical to the American manufacturing industry . While the administration could use executive carve-outs or other temporary measures to exempt USMCA-qualifying goods from new tariffs, such alternatives would be inherently unstable and inefficient. Executive actions can replicate certain tariff benefits without reopening the agreement, but they fail to provide the predictability firms require for long-term investment and supply-chain planning. Moreover, the value of USMCA extends well beyond tariff elimination. The agreement embeds stronger disciplines on intellectual property, digital trade, regulatory transparency, and trade-remedy procedures that collectively underpin America’s competitiveness. Unilateral executive measures cannot substitute for these integrated, legally binding commitments. Moreover, as noted, the Trump administration should make the USMCA a wholly tariff-free trade zone. Instead of raising tariffs on goods originating from the USMCA, the United States should prioritize encouraging Canada and Mexico to reverse policies that harm American technology companies. ITIF’s aforementioned Big Tech Policy Tracker—which catalogs more than 90 measures that disadvantage U.S. technology firms overseas—identifies several Canadian and Mexican policies that contradict these principles. [62] For instance, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) imposes strict conditions on cross-border data transfers, compelling U.S. companies to adopt costly, redundant local data systems instead of efficient, integrated networks. [63] Similarly, Mexico’s Cloud Service Restrictions introduce prescriptive data-management requirements for financial technology providers, constraining competition and limiting market access for U.S. cloud service firms. [64] Policymakers and trade negotiators should resolve these irritants through dialogue and digital trade cooperation first—rather than resorting to tariff escalation as a primary option. Renewing the USMCA should remain a top priority for the Trump administration. The USMCA strengthens U.S. techno-economic power twofold: by expanding American supply chain networks by leveraging Canada’s and Mexico’s comparative advantages, and by weakening China’s manufacturing capacity by enabling reshoring investments and shifting imports from China to USMCA partners. The renewal of USMCA should be subject to Canada and Mexico fulfilling their previous commitments—particularly Mexico on intellectual property issues—and should include modernized provisions to shield the North American economy from Chinese mercantilism, as well as include updates to digital trade and IPR-related provisions. Since the USMCA came into effect, new digital trade agreements and related initiatives have emerged, offering lessons and references for the USMCA review. Notable here are USMCA negotiations concluded before the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic crisis spurred a push, particularly among developing economies, to boost their digital economies, as digitalization among firms in those countries increased. [65] It raised awareness among policymakers about the need for digital trade rules—notably, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) urged the proliferation of digital trade agreements as a response to the crisis a few months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. [66] In this context, since 2020, there has been a notable expansion of digital trade agreements, digital economy agreements, and e-commerce or digital trade chapters within free trade agreements. Below is a description of the most relevant advances in digital trade agreements, by their relevance to U.S. policymaking: ▪ The World Trade Organization (WTO) Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce (JSI). The WTO’s JSI concluded five years of negotiations in July 2024—notably with the United States pulling out from this deal. [67] The agreement sets common rules and provisions to enable cross-border e-commerce. JSI participants are committed to proceeding with the domestic legal process, as with any trade agreement, with the expectation of integrating the outcome of negotiations into the WTO legal framework. [68] ▪ General Review of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The CPTPP chapter on e-commerce has served as a template for digitally related provisions in trade agreements since its inception in 2018. [69] In November 2023, CPTPP members agreed to conduct a general review of the agreement to assess its operation and identify provisions to update. Many CPTPP members have established an open consultation for this. The general review is expected to be concluded by the end of 2025, with the next steps outlined. [70] The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) released its recommendations in June 2025 for reforming the CPTPP’s e-commerce chapter. [71] PECC urges the CPTPP to adopt JSI as a baseline to formalize the CPTPP’s e-commerce chapter as the global template for digital trade rules. It also recommends turning this section into a “digital economy” chapter, administered by a secretariat to facilitate its operation and industry engagement, covering standards on cloud services, AI governance, cross-border data sharing, and digital trade infrastructure. ▪ Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). This “mega regional” trade agreement among the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states and Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea entered into force in 2022. China played a central role in the negotiations. [72] But RCEP has weak enforcement mechanisms, and all provisions can be carved out on grounds of “national interest.” In fact, China, despite being a promoter of this agreement, does not meet the e-commerce provisions in several key areas. For instance, China falls short when it comes to implementing an electronic transaction law aligned with the principles of the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law, adopting a non-discrimination approach to protect users from violations of personal information protection, ensuring free cross-border data flows, and refraining from implementing data localization requirements. [73] ▪ The European Union’s (EU) push for digital trade agreements. Europe has become a relevant actor in global digital rulemaking. The EU has traditionally encouraged its trade partners—especially those with weaker negotiation powers—to adopt the EU’s digital policies, which are characterized by the precautionary principle approach. This framework favors ex-ante regulation, preventing the adoption of digital technologies until it is certain that any potential negative externality is addressed. The expansion of this framework into other jurisdictions is known as the “Brussels effect.” [74] The EU is now extending the “Brussels effect” to digital trade rules. The EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement (DTA) took effect in May 2025, while negotiations for the EU-South Korea DTA have concluded, and early discussions are underway for a possible DTA with Canada. [75] The “Brussels effect” is reflected in these agreements through the dominance of the precautionary principle, the emphasis on consumer protection over technology adoption, and carve-outs for cross-border data flows that enable EU officials to maintain strong privacy protections. [76] ▪ Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA). Signed by Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore, with South Korea’s accession in May 2024, this is a one-of-a-kind agreement that covers all aspects of the digital economy and e-commerce. [77] The DEPA sets clear, interoperable standards and best practices to ensure legal certainty in digital trade issues. Simultaneously, it supports an open and non-discriminatory global Internet as a foundation for emerging digital sectors like AI and creative industries. [78] ▪ ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA). Serving as a continuation of the ASEAN Agreement on E-Commerce signed in 2019, the DEFA will be the most significant South-South digital trade agreement globally. [79] The negotiations began in late 2023, concluded in October 2025, and the agreement is expected to be signed in 2026. [80] The DEFA negotiations have been using the CPTPP and DEPA as templates, and it is expected to incorporate language addressing Southeast Asia’s specific challenges, such as labor mobility and digital inclusion. [81] Table 1 summarizes the main countries in the global network of digital trade agreements. Among USMCA partners, the United States is the only country not involved in these agreements. Canada is a CPTPP member and endorsed the JSI and, in August 2022, began discussions to initiate DEPA accession; as previously mentioned, it is also exploring a DTA with the EU. [82] Mexico, while less active than Canada, is a CPTPP member and endorsed JSI.

While the USMCA’s digital trade provisions cover, at their core, topics similar to those of the CPTPP and DEPA, the latter two agreements include more non-binding provisions on emerging issues—particularly DEPA. Table 2 summarizes which provisions are covered in the CPTPP’s e-commerce chapter, USMCA digital trade chapter, DEPA, RCEP’s e-commerce chapter, and the WTO’s JSI. DEPA, in particular, innovates by incorporating non-binding provisions on topics outside the USMCA scope, such as e-invoicing, e-payment, digital ID interoperability, AI principles, and data innovation for public services.

"Fact of the Week: R&D Investment Is Slowing in OECD Countries, From 3.6 Percent to 2.4 Percent",2025-11-03,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), OECD Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook 2025 (Paris: OECD, 2025), 16-21. Commentary: Despite the critical role that science, technology, and innovation (STI) policies play in spurring economic growth and responding to international crises, investment in research and development (R&D) has been slowing in recent years. Fiscal pressures from rising national debt and inflation have driven policymakers to favor policies with short-term gains over long-term sustainability, thereby reducing the attractiveness of STI policies such as R&D investment. Between 2022 and 2023, R&D investment in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) nations grew by 2.4 percent, a slowdown from the 3.6 percent growth the previous year. On the other hand, China, which is not an OECD nation, experienced an 8.7 percent growth in gross R&D investment. Research investment as a share of gross domestic product (GDP), otherwise known as R&D intensity, stood at 2.7 percent in 2023, with low growth rates across several OECD nations, including the United States (1.7 percent) and the EU (1.6 percent).",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/11/03/rd-investment-slowing-in-oecd-countries/
The Right Way for Canada to Secure Cloud Sovereignty,2025-10-29,Lawrence Zhang,"Ottawa is promoting a “sovereign cloud” as the next frontier of nation building. But as Lawrence Zhang writes in Policy Options , real sovereignty in digital systems isn’t about where servers sit—it’s about who controls access, who holds the keys, and who can say no when others seek Canadian data. Zhang warns that building domestic server farms risks wasting billions on symbolism without improving security, control, or economic competitiveness. Instead, Canada should “build sovereignty into contracts and cryptography,” treating control over data the same way it treats control over defence technology: Procurement standards : Use enforceable rules to stipulate who can access sensitive workloads Canadian-cleared personnel : Require domestic oversight for classified or critical systems Encryption control : Ensure Ottawa alone holds encryption keys for government data If Ottawa’s goal is control over Canadian data and its security, these measures provide the right levers. If instead the goal is economic development, policymakers should ask whether scarce public funds are better spent replicating global cloud infrastructure or investing in high-impact areas such as AI, quantum, and cybersecurity. Zhang cautions that trying to fuse these two goals into a single “sovereignty” initiative risks achieving neither, resulting in weaker security at higher cost and no real industrial payoff. The lessons from abroad are clear: most governments have found that real sovereignty comes from partnerships with global providers that guarantee domestic control, not from building new homegrown cloud platforms. Canada should follow suit. If the objective is control and security, hardwire it into contracts; if it is industrial policy, focus on sectors where Canada can truly lead. As Zhang concludes, “Real sovereignty is about control and leverage, not the logo on the server rack.” Read the full commentary in Policy Options .",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/29/right-way-for-canada-to-secure-cloud-sovereignty/
"Better Regulation, Not More: Rethinking Korea’s Competition Policy for the Next Decade Platform Regulation—Between Fairness and Innovation Panel 2: Corporate Governance—Redefining the KFTC’s Role Panel 3: Enforcement and Institutional Reform—From Control to Trust",2025-11-03,Sejin Kim,"With the appointment of Chairman Joo Byung-ki and a forthcoming reorganization, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) faces a pivotal moment. ITIF’s Center for Korean Innovation and Competitiveness convened a webinar with four leading experts to explore how the commission can balance regulation, innovation, and competitiveness across three areas: platform markets, corporate governance, and procedural reform. Throughout the discussion, panelists emphasized the need for transparent and predictable enforcement that sustains market confidence and innovation. A full transcript of the event is available in Korean , and a summary follows. As the KFTC enters its fifth decade, it is clear its mission must evolve—from control to credibility, and from compliance to competitiveness. The session opened with a central question: “Should Korea establish a dedicated platform law, or should the KFTC pursue fairer digital-market outcomes through guidance and ex-post enforcement within existing statutes?” Hong cautioned strongly against copying Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). “The EU adopted the DMA out of desperation,” he said, noting that Europe lacked domestic tech champions and needed an aggressive instrument to discipline U.S. giants. “Korea’s situation is entirely different. We already have globally competitive national platforms—this is not an ICU patient that needs radical treatment.” He stressed that the KFTC already possesses extensive powers under the Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Act (MRFTA) and its many derivative statutes governing subcontracting, franchising, and agency transactions. “Korea’s existing legal architecture already covers unfair-trade practices and transaction-fairness rules that the EU doesn’t even have,” he said. Creating another DMA-style act would duplicate those powers while adding complexity. Instead, Hong urged regulators to refine current rules, clarify guidance, and let market-led compliance evolve. “If we rush to legislate,” he warned, “we’ll bury domestic innovators under compliance paperwork while U.S. and Chinese platforms keep expanding globally.” Park mentioned the Online Platform Fairness Act and Online Platform Monopoly Regulation Act now under discussion in the National Assembly as likely to have limited effectiveness. “Both bills lack sufficient research and social consensus to be legislated efficiently,” he said. “A list-based approach to regulating unfair conduct by platforms is unlikely to work in practice.” He added, “The In-App Payment Ban Act passed but had almost no practical effect. Even without creating new laws, effective competition-law enforcement is possible under the current framework—if we first establish a solid analytical foundation for its underlying principles.” Choi began by questioning the very need for a new law dedicated to platform fairness. “I’m not convinced that we need a separate statute to regulate the fairness of intermediary platforms or delivery apps,” he said. “The Fair Trade Act already prohibits unfair trade practices, including abuse of superior bargaining position, and has done so effectively for many years.” He explained that Korea already has multiple special laws that function as exceptions or extensions of the Fair Trade Act—such as the Subcontracting Act, Franchise Business Act, and Agency Transactions Act—each enacted under different circumstances but with slightly differing scopes and standards. “These laws often overlap,” Choi noted. “For instance, when a transaction falls under the Agency Act, that law takes precedence. Yet because of regulatory gaps in certain enforcement notices, courts have recently ruled that some cases must instead be sanctioned under the Fair Trade Act. This shows how confusing the system already is.” Because of this patchwork, firms face rising compliance burdens and uncertainty. Choi warned that another special law could increase regulatory overlap, inflate legal risk, and discourage business activity rather than promote fairness. “A new law might temporarily patch policy gaps,” he said, “but it would likely create longer-term side effects—higher costs, redundant oversight, and hesitation among businesses to engage in mutually beneficial activities.” He emphasized that regulation should not stifle win–win cooperation between platforms and their partner merchants. “There are many reasonable, mutually beneficial forms of collaboration that can improve consumer welfare,” he said. “Yet when companies fear legal exposure, they may simply stop trying.” Choi gave an example: “Small and medium-sized firms use platforms as key distribution channels. If both sides agree to share marketing costs in a fair proportion, that can increase overall sales. But if regulations begin dictating transaction terms—such as setting statutory limits on commissions—there’s no guarantee such rules will lessen burdens on merchants, and they may even reduce benefits for consumers.” He concluded that before crafting new rules, policymakers should carefully assess whether additional statutes truly serve fairness—or merely multiply complexity and compliance risk in an already crowded legal landscape. Kim broadened the discussion to Korea’s strategic competitiveness. “In a world where our firms compete with Google, Amazon, and Meta,” he said, “we cannot afford to regulate ourselves out of the race.” Korea, he reminded, is one of only four countries—alongside the U.S., China, and Russia—with a native-language search engine and major e-commerce player. He agreed with Hong that Europe’s DMA was a protectionist, last-resort measure—a “drastic prescription” for an ailing digital sector. “Some even joke that Europe’s ESG agenda itself functions as a trade barrier,” Kim said. “Copy-and-paste regulation from that context would be misguided.” Kim pointed to the 2024 Wemakeprice payment-default incident as evidence that systemic risks can emerge not from large incumbents but from smaller platforms lacking governance capacity. “Major big platforms like Naver, Kakao, and Coupang have actually improved co-existence with small businesses—shortening settlement cycles and building trust,” he said. “We should recognize those advances instead of penalizing scale.” He urged regulators to adopt an industrial-policy lens, supporting domestic champions in the face of global competition rather than constraining them pre-emptively. “Over-regulation of our own firms will erode Korea’s position in AI-driven platform innovation.” The panel converged on a size-neutral, ex-post enforcement approach emphasizing transparency, consistency, and evidence-based harm analysis—positioning the KFTC as a referee, not a controller. The discussion then turned to the intersection of corporate law and competition policy. Korea now operates under dual oversight systems: judicial enforcement through the Commercial Act and administrative enforcement through the KFTC. Kim noted that the KFTC had long played a vital role in protecting minority shareholders when civil remedies were underdeveloped. “In the past, when private enforcement was weak, the Fair Trade Commission effectively acted as a ‘guardian of shareholders,’” he said. “But with recent amendments to the Commercial Act and the growing use of shareholder activism and civil litigation, investor protection should now be handled mainly through corporate and civil law. The KFTC should refocus on its core mission—addressing anticompetitive conduct.” He added that the Commission’s current approach, which penalizes both parent and subsidiary firms in intra-group transactions and fails to distinguish between wholly and partially owned affiliates, often results in “double punishment” and should be reconsidered. “The Fair Trade Act is an administrative regime, not a civil one,” Kim explained. “When firms treat it purely as regulation to avoid, rather than as a framework for shareholder fairness, its limits become clear. As Korea’s civil and corporate law remedies mature, the KFTC’s role should gradually narrow and concentrate on competition issues.” Park of Korea University Law School cautioned against rushing new legislation that fails to consider the structural features of digital platforms. “Platforms have very low entry barriers but strong network effects that naturally lead to concentration,” he explained. “Because users join platforms precisely to connect with others, these network effects generate clear consumer benefits. That is why it has always been difficult to apply traditional monopoly or competition-law principles directly to platform markets.” He continued, “The key issue is not whether to create new laws, but whether we have the necessary empirical research and social consensus to make them effective. The current Platform Fairness Act and Platform Competition Promotion Act are being pushed forward without such groundwork. Both take a list-based approach to defining ‘unfair acts’ observed in existing platforms, but this method is unlikely to be effective.” Park pointed to the 2021 In-App Payment Ban Act as a telling example. “It was passed, but had virtually no real impact,” he said. “Even without creating new laws, we can regulate platform conduct under the existing competition law—if we first establish a solid analytical foundation for its underlying principles.” Choi said, “Corporate internal governance is maturing—through more robust board deliberations, multi-layered external legal reviews, and heightened awareness of directors’ fiduciary duties. The KFTC’s role as an adjudicator may somewhat diminish, as alternative mechanisms that had not functioned effectively in the past are becoming more active. If these emerging systems can coexist and operate in harmony with the traditional KFTC-centered framework, they could create meaningful synergy.” Hong reframed the debate as one of incentives. he said, “It is true that the KFTC has long intervened even in matters that should have been resolved through judicial processes, and I agree that its domain of intervention should now gradually be reduced.” He continued, “The KFTC’s current approach to regulating corporate group governance no longer fits today’s economic reality. IT companies have fundamentally different ownership and governance structures from traditional manufacturers, yet they are still subject to outdated, accounting-based regulations. As a result, Korea has seen little progress in developing more advanced or diversified corporate group models. If the purpose of corporate group regulation is to promote sound and desirable governance, the system should be complemented by incentive mechanisms that actually encourage such evolution.” The debate illustrated the need for functional specialization: corporate law should address governance and shareholder issues, while the KFTC should focus on competitive effects and structural incentives. Transparency and predictability in governance are the foundation of trust. Whether through courts or the KFTC, the objective must be to build credible, investor-friendly institutions that strengthen—not constrain—Korea’s global standing. The final session addressed persistent concerns from businesses about opaque procedures and overlapping investigations. Hong called for institutional downsizing and clearer specialization within the KFTC. “The Commission tries to do everything—platform regulation, consumer protection, conglomerate oversight—and ends up overstretched,” he said. Staff rotations and performance incentives, he added, encourage quantity of investigations over procedural rigor. He emphasized that due process and evidence-based fact-finding are the legal foundations of fair enforcement, yet these principles often suffer under the Commission’s workload. “Korea’s pursuit of both speed and fairness has become structurally incompatible,” he observed. Hong proposed delegating routine fair-trade cases—such as franchise or local transaction disputes—to provincial authorities, allowing the KFTC to focus on systemic market-competition issues. He further recommended separating investigation and adjudication functions, citing the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority as a model for balanced institutional design. “The KFTC should stop trying to act as a first-instance court,” Hong concluded. “It should make swift, clear administrative decisions, while an independent appeals body handles final judgment. Only then can the Commission focus on what it does best—ensuring competition, not managing everything.” Choi elaborated on recent procedural improvements within the KFTC’s investigative system — including restrictions on full-disk imaging during digital forensics, exclusion of compliance departments from on-site inspections, and more systematic cataloguing of evidence. He welcomed these changes as signs of progress toward procedural fairness but underscored that significant gaps remain. “When the KFTC collects materials not only from investigated firms but also from third parties, it should manage and disclose them under a unified, transparent system,” he said. “Currently, only evidence favorable to the authority’s case tends to be catalogued, while other materials may be neglected.” Choi argued that defendants’ access rights — such as viewing and copying case files — are still too limited, often denied on grounds of trade secrecy. “That undermines procedural balance,” he noted, calling for full transparency and standardized evidence disclosure in line with OECD due-process norms. He also highlighted Korea’s lack of statutory attorney–client privilege, warning that it weakens compliance culture: “Without explicit privilege protection, companies hesitate to consult legal counsel proactively. We must embed legal certainty into compliance itself.” Choi concluded that data seizure should be narrowly tailored and harm-linked, focusing on relevance rather than volume, to ensure that investigative rigor does not come at the expense of fairness. Park spotlighted weak private enforcement and excessive agency deference. He cited a case where the KFTC halted investigation of a telecom affiliate’s preferential zero-rating practice after seeking input from another ministry. “Specialized regulators often protect incumbents,” he said. “The KFTC must own its competition mandate.” He also called for stronger discovery rules, timely file access, and judicial review of evidence handling to strengthen trust in enforcement outcomes. At a deeper level, Kim questioned whether the core mission of the Fair Trade Act—unchanged since the 1980s—still fits today’s economy. “The law’s purpose clause still speaks of preventing economic concentration ,” he noted. “But does it truly benefit Korea if Samsung performs poorly? Over five million Koreans hold its shares, and its success boosts pension and national-fund returns.” He argued that the guiding principle should no longer be dispersing economic power but preventing its abuse . “Our constitution prohibits abuse of economic power, not concentration itself,” he said. “Competition policy should evolve from restraining size to restraining abuse.” Kim warned that Korea’s competition regime remains excessively punitive. “The Fair Trade Commission still relies too heavily on criminal referrals,” he said, “creating reputational and economic risks that far outweigh the actual harm.” He urged a shift toward civil remedies and proportional sanctions, aligning Korea’s enforcement model more closely with OECD practice. He also welcomed the KFTC’s recent step to ease unfair-support scrutiny for wholly owned subsidiaries, calling it “a small but meaningful step toward economic rationality.” “Competition policy is not about punishing success; it’s about ensuring that antitrust rules and predictable enforcement of them drive innovation.” The October 23 webinar underscored a shared conclusion: Korea’s next-generation competition policy must move beyond the question of ‘more or less regulation’ toward enforcing antitrust rules in a way that does not see size as a problem per se, is economically coherent, procedurally fair, and institutionally credible. For Korea’s KFTC, now marking its fifth decade, this is a moment to lead: from control to credibility, and from compliance to competitiveness.

"No, Microsoft’s Recent Changes Do Not Prove the Activision Deal Was Anticompetitive",2025-10-27,Giorgio Castiglia,"Lina Khan is reportedly having the “ last laugh ” about the Microsoft/Activision deal, which she attempted to block as chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) during the Biden administration. Due to some recent changes at the company, including layoffs and a rise in the price of Game Pass Ultimate, the elite tier of Microsoft’s gaming subscription service, Khan has claimed that the company is now “too big to care,” implying that the deal should have been stopped according to her wishes. But there are many problems with jumping to a post hoc ergo propter hoc conclusion that these changes were caused by the Activision deal. In fact, the changes that Khan highlights do not appear to have been caused by the foreclosure concerns that motivated the attempt to block the deal. First, Khan’s suggestion that the deal is contributing to “increasing consolidation” is extremely misleading. This wasn’t a horizontal merger between two competitors that produce substitute goods, but a vertical deal between two firms combining complementary assets. Furthermore, the motivation for the acquisition was to better compete with rival Sony, which Microsoft has trailed for decades and which still has the largest market share in the global console market. What’s more, dynamic forces at work that are significantly constraining market power: Notably, mobile gaming continues to overtake regular console gaming in total sales by a large margin, with almost double the revenue of consoles in 2024. Moreover, the price increase for Game Pass Ultimate—from $19.99 per month to $29.99 per month—does not show that the deal was anticompetitive. Before the October 1 change , Game Pass had three tiers for consoles called “Core,” “Standard,” and “Ultimate.” After October 1, the three tiers remain, but the first two are now called “Essential” and “Premium” and have not experienced any price increase. Rather, Microsoft has upgraded its offerings available across the different tiers of Game Pass subscriptions. Indeed, as mentioned in a recent Stratechery article, “Game Pass Premium will be priced at the same $14.99 monthly price of the existing Standard subscription, but it will now have a bigger library of games to choose from.” Similarly, Ultimate is experiencing a number of upgrades, including “day-one” access to new releases of major titles, automatic access to Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft Plus, and enhanced cloud gaming quality. On a quality-adjusted basis, therefore, the real price of the subscription has not risen as much as the nominal figure may suggest. Even if quality-adjusted prices did increase, there is no evidence it is due to foreclosure, which was the central theory of harm in the FTC’s case to block the deal. Specifically, the Khan FTC’s entire complaint rested on the claim that Microsoft would be able to increase prices by foreclosing key inputs, particularly the Call of Duty franchise, to console rivals like Sony. But rather than foreclose Sony, Microsoft has an agreement with the company not to do so, and Call of Duty remains available to other major players, such as Nintendo—a condition for approval of the deal in the European Union. Interestingly, rather than divert sales from Sony to Microsoft, as foreclosure theory would predict, precisely the opposite appears to have occurred. That is, including super hit titles like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in Game Pass Ultimate increased subscriptions only modestly when compared to the estimated $300 million in standalone sales of the game that Microsoft lost out on. At the same time, Sony sold 82 percent of the standalone purchases of the game, which remained the most popular title in 2024 (interestingly, Sony hasn’t offered the title on its competing subscription service, PS Plus). Finally, although Khan has expressed concern about recent layoffs at the company, tech sector layoffs, as documented by Crunchbase, have been a secular economic trend and other companies have laid off more employees than Microsoft in recent years. This trend is likely due to a host of exogenous factors, such as tariffs and overstaffing during the surge in demand for tech company services that followed the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, it is overreaching at best to suggest that any meaningful number of layoffs in Microsoft’s gaming division are due to the acquisition. Moreover, sympathy for those who lose their jobs notwithstanding, it is important to note that reducing headcount alone is not a cognizable antitrust harm. In many cases, it reduces costs, increases efficiency, and benefits consumers. At bottom, the Microsoft/Activision deal was driven by vigorous competition in a dynamic market that requires major investments to maintain the continuously improving gaming experiences that consumers have come to expect. The vertical combination of complementary assets is an important way that firms can achieve these capabilities when markets are dynamic and competition evolves quickly. As Microsoft’s struggle to challenge the largest incumbents in this space shows, this is easier said than done. Lina Khan has been too eager to suggest that she knew recent changes at Microsoft would occur after the deal and that her concerns about the deal have been vindicated. Rather, it’s more likely that the case was brought due to Khan’s long-standing animus toward American tech companies than to any deep insights about what would happen to the price of Game Pass or employment at Microsoft.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/27/no-microsoft-recent-changes-do-not-prove-activision-deal-was-anticompetitive/

Tracking and Copying Global Best-in-Class Productivity Practices,2025-10-31,Robert D. Atkinson,"I want more money for myself, my wife, and my kids; for America; for the world. And I want it ideally with less work. Why? I shouldn’t even have to say why. No one would have asked this question fifty years ago. More money—that is, more goods and services—means a better standard of living, better health, a cleaner environment, more public goods, and countless other benefits. So where does more money come from? It comes from workers producing more than they did before for the same number of hours. That’s called productivity growth. I am still amazed that, as far as I can ascertain, no country has a coherent national productivity strategy. Most nations want higher GDP, but the most they can do is try to keep the economy at full employment and ensure that factor inputs for business (infrastructure, scientific knowledge, skills, and so on) are adequate. No government, perhaps except for Singapore , actually studies industries and economic functions to determine how they could boost productivity, especially through technology. This is in part because most policymakers make the incorrect assumption that organizations, including businesses, governments, and nonprofits, are already as productive as they could be. Another reason, as I wrote in Think Like an Enterprise: Why Nations Need Comprehensive Productivity Strategies , is that governments assume their job is to get the overall conditions right and not really study or tinker with the “plumbing” and “mechanics” of the economic production system. But if that’s the case, why do we see such dramatic differences in productivity between similar organizations? There are international organizations that might play this role, like the OECD or the World Economic Forum, but they, like individual governments, focus on macroeconomics and factor inputs. So, what someone needs to do is initiate a global benchmarking effort of the most productive organizations in the world across hundreds of industries and functions—for example, payment processing or application processing. Consider the following examples: Some hospitals in China have established automated medication delivery systems . Some garbage collection systems, including in Australia , use one-person trucks with automated bin pickup and emptying. Some cities use automated waste collection systems. The Envac system in Stockholm 's Hammarby Sjöstad district stands out as one of the most automated residential waste systems in the world, using underground vacuum tubes that connect residential buildings to a central collection station. Korea 's Songdo International Business District uses a similar system. The Henn-na Hotel chain in Japan was the first staffed primarily by robots. Some restaurants, including in Japan and Korea, use robots to deliver food to tables. ICON, based in Texas, has pioneered large-scale 3D-printed construction that can produce a house’s basic structure in 24 to 48 hours with minimal human intervention. Some robotics companies have developed fully automated brick-laying robots that can construct the walls of a house in as little as two days. The Port of Rotterdam’s APM Terminals Maasvlakte II uses automated guided vehicles (AGVs) and automated stacking cranes, along with remote-controlled ship-to-shore cranes and AI-powered logistics-planning systems. Yara Birkeland , developed by Yara International, is the world's first fully electric and autonomous container ship. It uses autonomous navigation systems, automated mooring, charging, and cargo-handling systems. The BYD Shiyan plant in China, widely considered the world’s most automated car factory , utilizes advanced robotics, driverless vehicles, and 5G networks. Some warehouses are now fully autonomous, using robotic pickers and movers. The Australian-based mining company Rio Tinto Group is considered one of the most automated mining companies in the world, using self-driving trucks and robotic mining equipment. A growing number of train operators worldwide are adopting completely automated train systems. This kind of list should be massive and easily available. Yet, unless search engines and AI tools are missing something, such a compendium does not exist. To help governments advance productivity, the OECD (or another similar organization) should launch a global “best-in-class productivity through technology” compendium featuring examples across a wide range of industries. It should include details on how these organizations achieve such productivity and what it would take to enable widespread diffusion of these practices within OECD nations. For example: What is global best-in-class productivity in residential trash collection? What technology does it employ? What are the factors behind its success? Why is it not standard practice in other countries? What specific factors limit widespread adoption? And how can governments overcome these barriers? At the same time, national regulatory bodies, such as OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), should make it part of their mission, when reviewing agency regulations, to assess whether agencies are supporting or thwarting technological automation. A case in point is the Federal Railroad Administration’s consistent opposition to freight-rail automation. OIRA could ensure that the FRA is not overly risk-averse in issuing regulations that affect automation. If we want higher living standards, better health, and greater prosperity—for ourselves, our families, our nations, and the world—we must treat productivity growth as a deliberate pursuit, not a happy accident. A global effort to identify, study, and replicate best-in-class productivity practices would move us closer to that goal, ensuring that technology serves as the true engine of shared progress.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/31/tracking-and-copying-global-best-in-class-productivity-practices/
Canada’s Amazon Test: Encouraging Competition or Undermining It?,2025-10-30,Lawrence Zhang,"Parliament’s 2023 reforms to the Competition Act made it easier for the Competition Bureau to challenge supposedly dominant firms, giving it greater latitude to intervene when it suspects they are engaging in anticompetitive conduct. The Bureau’s investigation into Amazon’s Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy is one of the first major tests of that new flexibility. What’s at stake isn’t Amazon’s size but whether the pricing rules raise prices for Canadians. The short answer is: They don’t. The Competition Bureau is investigating whether Amazon’s Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy , which (among other things) can restrict placement for third-party sellers who list products on Amazon.ca at higher prices than on other Canadian sites, and in turn, allegedly allows Amazon to restrict rival marketplaces, raise seller fees, and weaken price competition across online retail. The inquiry closely parallels the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s ongoing antitrust case , which alleges that Amazon maintained monopoly power through “anti-discounting” rules similar to Amazon Canada’s pricing policy. ITIF has questioned that theory , noting it rests on uncertain economic assumptions and thin evidence of consumer harm. While the claims are similar, Canada’s new competition rules give the Bureau greater flexibility to act against conduct that it believes has “adverse effects on competition,” even when intent or consumer harm is difficult to prove. The 2023 reforms allow the Competition Tribunal to issue orders where a dominant firm’s conduct shows either anticompetitive intent or effect, rather than requiring both, and replace the older “substantial lessening of competition” effects test with the broader “adverse effect” standard, enabling earlier intervention without necessarily needing concrete evidence of consumer harm. By contrast, under the U.S. Sherman Act, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission must show both monopoly power (a higher standard than dominance) and consumer harm, typically through higher prices, reduced output, or lower quality. The evidentiary bar for proving illegality is therefore far higher than under Canada’s new framework. That difference could matter: If Canada can move forward on evidence that falls significantly short of what the U.S. Federal Trade Commission must prove, this case could set an early benchmark for how aggressively the Bureau uses its expanded mandate in digital markets. Some observers worry this shift could tilt Canada’s enforcement approach closer to Europe’s, where competition law often focuses on protecting competitors rather than directly improving consumer outcomes. Even under the new lower threshold, the Bureau’s case likely faces a basic analytical problem.It defines the market narrowly as the “supply of online marketplace services” to third-party sellers, treating Amazon as an infrastructure provider rather than a two-sided platform connecting sellers and consumers. That framing isolates one side of the market while ignoring the network effects that make platforms competitive in the first place. The marketplace’s value to sellers depends on how many consumers shop there, and its value to consumers depends on how many sellers offer low prices. Any assessment of dominance or harm should consider both sides together, not just one side in isolation. If the Bureau does the latter, it risks missing the very feedback loop that makes platforms work for consumers and sellers alike. Even if one just focuses on the supply side, the Bureau is missing the competitive dynamics that actually discipline Amazon’s behaviour. Sellers have multiple alternatives, like independent Shopify stores, specialized platforms like Newegg or SSENSE, rival marketplaces like eBay, Temu, and Well.ca, or brick-and-mortar retailers with online operations such as Walmart and Canadian Tire. Indeed, consumers continue to value in-person shopping: 61 percent of Canadians still make most purchases in physical stores, showing that online marketplaces are only one part of a broader retail ecosystem. The second issue is conduct. The Bureau is asking whether Amazon’s rule—which places limits on sellers who charge higher prices on Amazon than elsewhere—is anti-competitive. That is a hard case to make. Price-parity rules can, in theory, blunt discounting or slow new entrants, which could reflect coordinated pricing or exclusion, neither of which is likely to be proven here. Specifically, the inquiry treats Amazon’s Fair Pricing Policy as a platform-wide issue rather than a market-specific one. Yet Amazon sells millions of items across nearly every retail category. Demonstrating that its policy has raised prices or blocked rivals across the board will be a high bar to clear. Without clear evidence of consumer harm, the case risks becoming less about conduct and more about scale. In practice, Amazon’s policy also has pro-competitive benefits. Rather than harm competition, the Fair Pricing Policy reflect standard retail practice that even predates e-commerce. Retailers regularly require suppliers not to undercut them in other channels. The purpose is straightforward: Protect the retailer’s reputation for price competitiveness and predictability. Moreover, it is difficult to see how a policy designed to prevent mark-ups could leave Canadians paying more. Amazon’s policy keeps prices lower, not higher, on its platform. Interpreting that as price inflation risks punishing a policy that delivers exactly what competition is supposed to achieve—lower prices for consumers. A rule that prevents overpricing may frustrate rivals, but that frustration is not the same as harm to competition. In fact, lower prices attract more consumers, which in turn attract more sellers: a feedback loop that reflects competition on the merits. The Amazon case will test how Canada’s new competition law handles big digital platforms. The Bureau should only challenge Amazon’s price-parity rule if it has genuinely harmed Canadian consumers by raising prices or eliminating choice. Amazon’s practices may upset some sellers, but they keep prices consistent and low for consumers. Focusing only on sellers risks missing how competition actually works on platforms like Amazon, where lower prices and more buyers on one side attract more sellers on the other. The outcome of this investigation will say less about Amazon than about whether Canada intends to use its new competition tools to target successful digital platforms for the very practices that define retail competition on the merits.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/30/canadas-amazon-test-encouraging-competition-or-undermining-it/
Government Funding: The Unsung Hero of Innovation and Progress,2025-10-29,Justin Riggi,"While reducing government investment in scientific research and development may seem like a quick fix to help close the budget deficit, it poses long-term risks to national progress, public welfare, and global leadership. It is not an act of fiscal prudence, but rather a disinvestment in our future. As ITIF has previously written , a 20 percent cut in federal R&D spending would cost the American economy nearly $1.5 trillion. Scientific breakthroughs require sustained funding and long-term orientation. Unlike the private sector, governments have the capacity, scale, and obligation to invest in knowledge, even if it takes years or decades to yield benefits. According to the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics , the federal government has long been the primary source of funding for basic research in the United States. With that in mind, the U.S. government should increase funds allocated to such efforts so as not to cede global leadership in this area. In the development of novel technologies, publicly funded science frequently catalyzes subsequent innovation in the private sector. According to the European Research Council , over 40 percent of government-backed projects were cited in patents, illustrating this pipeline. The public sector serves to mitigate financial risk in early work so that companies can subsequently improve, scale, and commercialize it—creating jobs and improving lives. For example, the Internet did not originate in Silicon Valley, but rather in the U.S. Department of Defense. In the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) developed a pioneering network called ARPANET, designed to maintain communication during a nuclear event. At the time, no company saw the potential in networking mainframe computers, but because of government research efforts, what evolved is the Internet we know today. GPS technology, which now underpins entire industries—shipping, agriculture, transportation apps like Uber, delivery apps like DoorDash, satellite weather forecasting, global communication systems, and many others—also traces back to federally funded science programs. Perhaps no example in recent times is more powerful than the development of mRNA vaccine technology. The rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna was the culmination of decades of foundational research by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH scientists were working on RNA-based therapeutics and lipid nanoparticle delivery systems in the early 2000s. When the pandemic struck, researchers at private companies were able to quickly build upon that groundwork, producing the vaccines that saved millions of lives and reopened the global economy. According to the 2022 State of Science Index , nearly 60 percent of adult Americans became more appreciative of science as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), created during World War II to support the government’s military objectives and responsible for developing radar and the atomic bomb, saw many of its other inventions yield significant peacetime applications. These include, most notably, the mass production of penicillin , which revolutionized medicine, as well as the development of synthetic materials that laid the foundation for postwar advances in materials science and industrial innovation. Although OSRD existed only from 1941 to 1945, shortly after the end of World War II, the National Science Foundation (NSF) was founded in 1950 to continue supporting a wide range of scientific research, not just that related to defense. Similarly, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), founded in 1958 to compete with the Soviet Union during the Space Race, has since delivered far more to humanity than space missions alone. Its budget is often looked to as a source for cuts by both parties, even though NASA’s vast portfolio of developed technologies has driven breakthroughs that tackle global challenges while improving everyday life. Satellite-based Earth-observation systems monitor climate change, track natural disasters, and inform agricultural practices by analyzing soil moisture, crop health, and land use—transforming how we respond to climate risks and enhance food security. Moreover, advanced digital image processing and multispectral analysis, born from NASA’s space missions, have been adapted to improve medical diagnostics. Water purification systems developed for astronauts have led to portable filtration systems used in remote and disaster-stricken areas worldwide. NASA’s research in crash dynamics, materials science, and aviation safety has improved transportation by informing better seatbelt and child car seat design, advancing anti-icing protocols for aircraft, enhancing flight control software, and creating more impact-resistant car bumpers and panels. All of this has been achieved despite NASA’s continually shrinking budget , which has decreased from a peak of 4.4 percent of the federal budget in 1966 to only 0.3 percent today. Imagine how many more breakthrough discoveries could emerge with greater investment. Importantly, government-funded R&D does not occur only in federal labs, but also at universities where faculty and students, funded by federal grants, pursue novel research. This system has made American universities the global standard not just as teaching institutions, but also as incubators for innovation. Government-backed university scientists have contributed to a broad spectrum of real-world applications: CRISPR gene-editing tools, renewable battery technologies such as solid-state and lithium-sulfur systems, various cancer treatments like immunotherapy, algorithms that power artificial intelligence models, and improved materials for solar cells. Despite this, the federal government recently made substantial budget cuts to universities and the grants that fund university researchers. Basic scientific research is not a cost center but a strategic investment in long-term national innovation. While fiscal responsibility is important, austerity in areas such as scientific research risks crippling future technological progress. According to the International Monetary Fund , citations for scientific articles peak at eight years—more than double the three-year peak for patents—highlighting the enduring impact of basic research compared with applied research. Similarly, an MIT study found that a 10 percent increase in government defense R&D leads to a 5 to 6 percent rise in private-sector R&D in the same industry while also boosting total factor productivity growth by 5 percent annually. In sum, this underscores the powerful innovation spillover effect of public research funding. Innovation spillover is especially strong for smaller firms, according to findings in a report by economist Arnaud Dyevre for the European Central Bank, and explains about one-third of the U.S. productivity slowdown since 1950 amid declining public investment. Moreover, federally funded R&D investments also benefit society. Indeed, the American Enterprise Institute found that each dollar of public R&D investment yields $5 to $20 in social benefit. In fact, according to a 2023 report by Fieldhouse and Mertens , non-defense R&D funding significantly boosts private-sector innovation, accounting for roughly one-quarter of business productivity growth since World War II, with social returns estimated between 150 and 300 percent. Yet despite its centrality to innovation, security, and prosperity, U.S. federal R&D spending as a percentage of GDP has decreased from a peak of 2 percent in the 1960s to just 0.6 percent today. This trend is likely to worsen as President Trump plans to cut $5 billion from the NSF’s $9 billion budget next year, per The New York Times . Sustained investment in R&D is critical for global competitiveness. Other nations, including China, are rapidly increasing their science budgets, recognizing the strategic value of innovation—making investment in scientific research also a matter of national security. As ITIF has previously documented , in 2023, China invested $781 billion in R&D, only slightly trailing the United States’ $823 billion, and may already have surpassed U.S. spending when adjusted for cost. Moreover, China’s R&D growth rate is dramatically outpacing that of the United States. Countries that lead in science will shape the 21st century. If the United States retreats from science spending, it risks falling behind in key areas such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and green energy, thereby ceding technological leadership and undermining public welfare. The federal government must reverse this decades-long trend by increasing funding for research and development and modernizing the process by which that funding is allocated. Scientific American estimates that researchers spend nearly 40 percent of their time navigating administrative red tape just to apply for grants, which then demand excessive proof of immediate, short-term impact. Removing these inefficiencies would allow scientists to devote more of their time to actual research while still reducing bureaucratic overhead and saving taxpayer dollars. Scientific R&D represents our collective vision for what is possible, enabling us to be proactive, not reactive, in solving the challenges we face. However, doing so requires thinking beyond what we can envision today. Scientific breakthroughs rarely emerge from linear planning or narrow objectives but instead from sustained investment in a diverse range of disciplines—many of which may seem disconnected or speculative at first. Risks must be taken and patience must be exercised, because some of the most transformative discoveries arise from creating conditions that allow innovation to flourish. Only by investing in the future can we take advantage of all that it promises. Rather than asking whether we can afford to invest, we must ask whether we can afford not to.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/29/government-funding-the-unsung-hero-of-innovation-and-progress/
From Outside Assaults to Insider Threats: Chinese Economic Espionage Key Takeaways Introduction Conceptual Context Structures Types of Compromises Outlook Endnotes,2025-11-03,Darren E. Tromblay,"China’s campaign of economic espionage against the United States spans cyber intrusions, insider theft, and technology transfer disguised as collaboration.

While the movement of talent is a legitimate and even beneficial aspect of innovation, the PRC has taken advantage of this dynamic to facilitate the theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information. Beijing’s approach leverages the whole of society. A range of actors, including intelligence elements, companies, and students push the limits on legitimate behavior into theft. U.S. companies are targets for multiple reasons. Historically, they have been the engines of American defense R&D, creating new capabilities such as advanced aircraft (a technology that China has historically targeted) on behalf of the government. The PRC, which has been readying for conflict, has an interest in both the technology and what it means for the United States’ military posture. Even when the private sector’s R&D is delinked from the U.S. government, it often focuses on areas where the PRC has been attempting to cultivate indigenous capabilities, as defined in its Made in China 2025 project. The PRC’s campaign against U.S. sources, including industry, manifests itself in multiple ways. First, Beijing is responsible for attacks from the outside against American industry as well as government and academic institutions. These often take the form of cyber intrusions, such as those conducted by Peoples’ Liberation Army-affiliated hacking groups. Second, the PRC has sponsored multiple varieties of insider threats: employees who pass sensitive information to Chinese entities. Finally, PRC state-owned enterprises have used platforms in the United States—whether local consulting firms or branches of Chinese companies—to hire human capital from U.S. industry who possess and ultimately pass trade secret information (TSI). The PRC has consistently, explicitly advertised its intentions to engage in state-supported innovation. In 1986, the country unveiled the 863 Program, which pursued progress in supercomputing. [1] Then, in 2006, the PRC launched its Medium-to-Long Term Program for the Development of Science and Technology with the intent of facilitating indigenous innovation. Then, in 2015, the country introduced its Made in China 2025 initiative that was supposed to achieve breakthroughs in 10 high-value sectors. [2] These include next-generation information technology, robotics, aerospace, clean energy, and biotechnology. [3] China has persistently pursued a course to acquiring identified technological expertise (as well as specific technology), as opposed to just generating it internally. This concept is entrenched and dates to the beginning of the PRC. For instance, in 1949, the Chinese in U.S. Science Association stated, as an objective, the unification and cooperation with scientific workers in the PRC to advance scientific developments in that country. In 1950, the organization received a letter from the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers asking members of the U.S. group to return to China and advised that the PRC government had established a committee to handle arrangements for this. [4] More than 50 years later, the PRC’s playbook had not substantially changed. In 2006, the Chinese government established Project 111, which had the objective of recruiting 1,000 foreign experts from the world’s top 100 universities and research institutes. [5] Then, in 2008, the PRC launched its Thousand Talents Program with the intent of enticing scientists to bring their research to China. Economic espionage was a significant aspect of the Thousand Talents Program. Although many of the cases that the Department of Justice brought against talent plan participants involved academia, the private sector was not immune. In 2019, The New York Times reported that 600 recruits worked for U.S. companies. [6] These penetrations of the private sector, including Xiaoqing Zheng at General Electric and Xiaorong You at the Coca-Cola and Eastman Chemical, have included attempts to steal trade secrets on behalf of Chinese entities. [7] Almost as soon as the PRC opened to the United States in 1979, the PRC looked for ways to take advantage of incoming U.S. technology. The unmasking of the Thousand Talents Program as an inducement to espionage has forced the PRC to hide, rather than end, this way of doing business. After the U.S. began scrutinizing the Thousand Talents Program, the PRC removed a list of members from the Internet and references to the program disappeared. In place of the Thousand Talents Program, the PRC launched its National High-end Foreign Experts Recruitment Plan. [8] This new packaging of a concept that dates to the early days of the PRC targets the private sector. According to a translation of its application guide, the Recruitment Plan targets, among others, “[p]rofessional technical personnel or management personnel who hold senior positions in internationally renowned companies and institutions.” [9] Movement of expertise into the PRC’s innovation ecosystem supports Chinese hard power. From its earliest decades, the PRC has attempted to identify ways to use developments in the civilian sector for military purposes. Both Mao Zedong, using the term “military-civil combination,” and Deng Xiaoping pursued this transfer of knowledge. [10] Almost as soon as the PRC opened to the United States in 1979, the PRC looked for ways to take advantage of incoming U.S. technology. For instance, journalist John Fialka has recounted how the PRC, in exchange for doing business with the McDonnell aircraft company, demanded the technology and the right to produce increasingly large pieces of the planes that it purchased in Chinese factories. As these factories absorbed the manufacturing know-how from production of nose cones and fuselages for airliners, emerging versions of Chinese fighter aircraft began featuring better-produced fuselages and aluminum skins. [11] This process of transferring technology developed under civilian auspices to military purposes is now ingrained in the PRC’s approach to innovation. In 2007, Hu Jintao made the first mention of “military-civilian fusion” (MCF). [12] In 2014, the PRC elevated MCF to a national strategy. [13] A 2020 U.S. Department of Defense report explains that MCF consists of six aspects. These include integrating and leveraging science and technology innovations across military and civilian sectors as well as cultivating talent and blending military and civilian expertise and knowledge. [14] Therefore, it can be assumed that any expertise applied on behalf of—or technology provided to—a PRC entity will support that country’s ability to counter the United States and its allies militarily. The PRC’s intelligence services are key players in effecting the illicit transfer of specific technology and knowledge to that country. Civilian foreign intelligence collection is largely the domain of the Ministry of State Security (MSS). The PRC established the MSS in 1983 by merging several pre-existing entities, including several from the Ministry of Public Security (MPS)—which continues to operate. It consists of a primary central office, provincial departments, and municipal bureaus. [15] For instance, the MSS’s Jiangsu Province Ministry of State Security (JSSD), has, during the past decade, been involved with the targeting of U.S. aerospace technology. [16] Additionally, the intelligence components of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) play a significant role in the theft of U.S. private sector proprietary information. The General Staff Department Second Department (2PLA) is responsible for, among things, human intelligence (HUMINT). PRC cyber espionage against the private sector has been a persistent problem. Under the PLA, this is the responsibility of the Third Department (3PLA). [17] In 2014, the United States took the unprecedented step of indicting five Chinese hackers, working for the 3PLA’s Unit 61398, in response to a campaign of trade secret theft. [18] The PRC’s private sector is complicit in the collection of intelligence. In 2015, the PRC introduced its National Security Law, which requires all parties, including the ostensible private sector to “maintain national security.” [19] This was somewhat nebulous. What came next was not. The National Intelligence Law of 2017 mandated that all Chinese organizations assist with intelligence work and permitted PRC intelligence entities to establish relationships with relevant organizations. [20] Furthermore, the PRC has demonstrated its intent to leverage the Chinese information technology sector to support cyber-facilitated intelligence activities. In 2016, the PRC instituted its Cybersecurity Law which requires telecommunications companies such as Huawei to provide the government with “technical support and assistance.” [21] PRC private sector entities have repeatedly worked in conjunction with the country’s intelligence services. For instance, in July 2025, the Italian government, at the request of the United States, arrested Xu Zewei, who had worked for the Shanghai Powerock Network Co. Ltd. while taking hacking direction from the MSS’s Shanghai State Security Bureau. [22] Researchers at the Atlantic Council have identified the MSS’s collection of vulnerabilities from private-sector partners. The researchers, Dakota Cary and Kristin Del Rosso, assessed that the MSS almost certain evaluates these for offensive use. [23] The PRC government further co-opts business through the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Under the 1993 Company Law, all companies that employ more than three CCP members must establish a party cell. [24] Until the ascent of Xi Jinping, the requirement was lightly enforced. [25] Since Xi’s rise, the PRC government has become increasingly coercive in its use of the CCP. In 2018, new requirements mandated that publicly listed foreign joint ventures (the means by which U.S. companies do business in the PRC) establish CCP cells. [26] These cells engage in several pivotal functions including appointment of personnel and management decision-making. [27] This is apparent in the case of Cummins, a U.S.-based engine manufacturer. Cummins partnered with the PRC’s Dongfeng Motor Group and, when Cummins attempted to appoint a new manager for one of its Chinese entities, the CCP vetoed the decision. [28] The PRC has demonstrated its intent to leverage the Chinese information technology sector to support cyber-facilitated intelligence activities. Chinese actors have used a variety of methods to exfiltrate private sector data. These have ranged from simple theft (especially cyber attacks), to insider threats (individuals courted by Chinese entities walking out the door with sensitive information), to sophisticated, longer-term operations directed at reaching into companies to co-opt individuals with access—and willingness to transfer—proprietary information. The PRC has long-established itself as a practitioner of cyber espionage. While the technology employed in this is distinctly 21st century, there is nothing particularly novel about the underlying concept: simple theft by breaking and entering. Multiple hacking efforts by PRC entities had targeted the U.S. government in the first decade of the 21st century. The threat for industry, however, became stunningly apparent in 2010, when Google announced that China had stolen portions of the company’s source code in an attack referred to as Operation Aurora. This hack also targeted several dozen other corporations ranging from Intel to Morgan Stanley. [29] Operation Aurora emanated from Chinese academic institutions. According to The New York Times , investigators linked the hackers to Shanghai Jiaotong University, which, at the time, had one of the PRC’s leading computer science programs. Other participants, the Times reported, appeared to be affiliated with the Lanxiang Vocational School, which trains computer scientists for the PRC military. [30] It is unlikely happenstance that these attacks emanated from academic institutions. As The Economist noted in 2025, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has a long history of shaping students’ educational decisions. [31] A profusion of malicious computer science students is consistent with the PRC’s agenda. China’s use of academic institutions as cover for intelligence activity has become a routine practice in both the cyber and HUMINT domains. While Operation Aurora was the first significant warning that the PRC was turning its cyber resources on the private sector, it was not the first instance of this. Following Google’s announcement, researchers at the cybersecurity firm McAfee identified a cyberespionage campaign, which they named Night Dragon, that had been targeting multiple U.S. oil companies—specifically for business data such as bid information and potential sites for future operations—since 2008. [32] According to The Christian Science Monitor , which broke the story, the PRC’s exact role in Night Dragon was unknown, but information flowing from at least one company’s computer was going back to China. [33] Night Dragon’s targeting is consistent with subsequent PRC attacks. In 2018, for instance, the U.S. indicted two PRC MSS-affiliated hackers who, between 2006 and 2018, targeted a wide variety of companies, from across multiple industries, including one involved in oil and gas drilling, production, and processing. [34] Identifying that these threat activities were ongoing was the first step toward curbing the PRC cyberthreat. In 2014, the United States, for the first time, indicted five Chinese military hackers on economic espionage and related charges. These individuals were officers in the PLA Third Department’s Unit 61398. Targets included Westinghouse technology, SolarWorld business information (including attorney-client communications regarding litigation about Chinese solar product manufacturers’ “dumping” practices), and Alcoa internal discussions about a partnership with a PRC state-owned enterprise. [35] PRC entities have employed increasingly sophisticated ruses to facilitate social engineering ploys such as phishing emails. The 2014 indictment set for the stage for what can only be described as a naive agreement on the U.S. government’s part. In 2015, President Barack Obama announced that he had reached an agreement with the PRC’s Xi Jinping that “neither the U.S. or the Chinese government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property … for commercial advantage.” [36] It was unlikely that a practitioner of outright theft, such as the PRC, would uphold its end of the bargain. The cybersecurity firm FireEye initially tallied that network compromises by PRC-backed hacking groups had dropped from 60 in early 2013 to fewer than 10 by mid-2016. As the Council on Foreign Relations’ Adam Segal cautioned, however, “Absence of evidence is not the same thing as evidence of absence, and the Chinese may be becoming more stealthy and sophisticated in their attacks.” [37] PRC state-sponsored hacking continued, as indicated by subsequent indictments. In 2021, the U.S. charged personnel associated with the MSS’s Hainan State Security Department (HSSD) with an extensive hacking campaign, between 2011 and 2018. [38] Targets included a U.S. information technology company located in California; a U.S. defense contractor, also located in that state; a U.S. company in the mid-Atlantic region involved with the manufacture of aircraft and marine craft; an aircraft servicing company headquartered in New Jersey with repair and maintenance services at airports globally; a U.S. airline; and a U.S. defense contractor headquartered in Virginia, which was involved with maritime R&D. [39] This case showed the continuing relationship between Chinese intelligence and higher education. Members of the HSSD-led conspiracy worked with staff and professors at both an identified PRC university and college to identify and recruit talented computer hackers. Additionally, members of the conspiracy worked with those institutions to identify and recruit linguists capable of interpreting stolen material. [40] These attacks did not require an insider threat but, when necessary, exploited mistakes by targeted companies’ employees. Spear-phishing emails got Chinese actors into company systems. In 2009, a Google employee received a message with an embedded link, which they clicked and opened the door to Operation Aurora. [41] (In early 2010, Reuters reported that Google was also looking at whether individuals working in Google China’s office facilitated the attack. [42] ) A similar ruse, using an email that appeared to be sent by a Marathon Oil employee, containing a link, introduced the Night Dragon attack. [43] PRC entities have employed increasingly sophisticated ruses to facilitate social engineering ploys such as phishing emails. For instance, in the 2021 case, involving the HSSD, conspirators employed doppelganger domain names, which intentionally resembled links to legitimate companies. This increased the chances that a harried employee, skimming the email, would take the bait. Additionally, conspirators created fictitious online profiles, associated with spear-phishing email accounts, to increase the appearance of legitimacy. [44] Outsider attacks may also use very traditional, physical means. For instance, in 2004, an employee of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei entered a trade show in the middle of the night, after the event had concluded and visited the booth of a technology company. The employee’s badge listed his employer as “Weihua” (“Huawei” with the syllables reversed). Once at the booth, the employee removed the cover from a networking device and took photographs of the circuitry inside. [45] The PRC has not simply smashed and grabbed with cyberattacks. It has benefitted from the perfidy of trusted insiders who have helped Beijing to siphon off proprietary information. Programs such as Thousand Talents and its successors have encouraged the illicit transfer of knowledge as individuals, whether for patriotism or profit, have crossed the line from the legitimate pursuit of opportunities to engage in theft. Insider threats take three primary forms. The simplest takes the form of employees who end their employment by walking out of their employers’ doors with privileged information. More complex are those individuals who remain employed by the private sector but, throughout this employment, transfer information to Chinese entities. The third form of insider threat is those employees who unlock doors for other PRC actors. Over approximately the past decade, the U.S. government has disrupted multiple efforts by individuals to transfer information from their private sector employers to entities in the PRC. A number of these instances have occurred under the auspices of the Thousand Talents Program. Although the program has a new name, it is unlikely, given the trajectory of China’s approach to illicit technology transfer, that the basic concept will change. The case of Yu Long provides an example of how the PRC has attempted to penetrate the defense sector. In 2013, Long expressed interest in and was subsequently accepted to the Thousand Talents Program. [46] The PRC asked Long to provide documents, to validate claims in his TTP application, acquired through his work at the United Technologies Research Center (which included work with companies including Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky). [47] Long explicitly stated that his aim was to “help China to mature its own aircraft engines.” [48] In November 2014, Long was arrested after trying to fly to the PRC with export-controlled and proprietary documents related to F-22 and F-35 engines. [49] Long eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal trade secrets knowing that this would benefit a foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent. [50] Xiaorong You is another individual who envisioned profiting from her employers by leveraging TSI to obtain a payment from the Thousand Talents (as well as a local version of the) program. The TSI at stake was bisphenol-A (BPA)-free coating for food packaging. (BPA, which had been used to minimize flavor loss and prevent containers from corroding or reacting with their contents, was linked to possible harmful effects, hence the need for an alternative.) [51] The Coca-Cola Company employed You as the principal engineer for global research between 2012 and 2017. [52] In this capacity, You had access to TSI belonging to six companies including Dow Chemical and Sherwin Williams. [53] While still employed by Coca-Cola, You agreed with Liu Xiangchen, and co-conspirator #1, to transfer stolen TSI to the Chinese company Weihai Jinhong Group and become an employee of that company. Xiangchen would arrange for the Chinese company to not only pay You for her participation in the conspiracy but also assist her in obtaining Thousand Talent and locally distributed provincial government awards. [54] You lied to one employer and penetrated another for the purpose of stealing TSI. When she left Coca-Cola in August 2017, she signed a written agreement, falsely attesting that she had not retained and no longer had access to TSI or other confidential information. The same month You agreed to this, she opened files on a computer containing TSI and took photographs of the screen to bypass security measures. In September 2017, she obtained employment at Eastman Chemical Company in part to steal TSI information in furtherance of the conspiracy. She took photographs of Eastman’s laboratory equipment, located in secure and restricted locations, to show Xiangchen the industrial equipment needed. Upon learning that Eastman planned to fire her, You uploaded company TSI to her Google drive. [55] The conspiracy had the potential to significantly damage U.S. R&D. Companies involved in developing BPA-free coatings had spent approximately $120 million to develop it. [56] You and her Chinese corporate partner Weihai Jinhong Group received millions of dollars in Chinese grants to support a second company, owned in part by Weihai Jinhong Group, You, Liu, and co-conspirator #1. This second company would partner with an Italian company for the purpose of establishing a market presence in China for the TSI that You had furnished to Weihai Jinhong Group. The conspirators planned to compete with U.S. companies, including some of the owners of the stolen TSI, in China and globally. [57] Fortunately, for the companies involved, the U.S. government identified and disrupted You’s conspiracy. In April 2021, a federal jury convicted You of multiple crimes including conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and economic espionage. [58] The PRC academic apparatus—students and institutions—have facilitated penetration of U.S. entities by insider threats. Wei Pang came to the United States in 2001 as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California (USC). Almost immediately after graduating in 2006, Pang took a job with Avago, which produced bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters for wireless devices. Avago’s technology contained trade secrets. Another Chinese student, Hao Zhang, also earned a Ph.D. at USC and, after graduating in 2006, took a job with Skyworks, an innovator of semiconductors. Huisui Zhang earned a masters degree in electrical engineering, in 2006 from USC as well, and went to work for Micrel Semiconductor. [59] The PRC academic apparatus—students and institutions—have facilitated penetration of U.S. entities by insider threats. Shortly after entering the U.S. technology sector, all three individuals began to develop a plan for exfiltrating trade secrets from Avago and Skyworks. Their plan was to establish a BAW fabrication facility in the PRC—an objective that they explicitly linked to improving PRC military capabilities. In 2006, Huisui Zhang emailed Wei Pang and Hao Zhang notes about establishing a BAW fabrication facility in the PRC (the understanding that this would involve illicit activity was confirmed shortly thereafter by a warning from Pang to maintain secrecy about the plan). Pang later suggested that they call the company “cliftbaw” for “China lift BAW technology.” [60] A Chinese university became a conspirator in this plan. Tianjin University (TJU) was a member institution of the PRC’s 985 Project—which provided state funding to develop flagship schools. [61] TJU entered into a joint venture with Wei Pang, Hao Zhang, and others as a vehicle to “launder” trade secrets for use by TJU in establishing its own fabrication facility. The university even provided guidance for establishing a shell company in the Cayman Islands that would appear to the be source for the trade secrets stolen from Avago and Skyworks. [62] To establish academic legitimacy that would justify their hiring by TJU, Pang and Hao Zhang needed patents. Both individuals applied for patents using technology and trade secrets they stole from their respective employers. Hao Zhang applied for the U.S. patents in order to keep Avago’s name off the information that was coming from it through Pang. The corresponding PRC patents were filed under both Pang’s and Hao Zhang’s names. [63] The U.S. victims only learned of their loss when Pang’s former boss traveled to Tianjin to visit Pang and recognized the stolen Avago technology in Pang’s laboratory. [64] One by one, the conspirators departed the United States for the safety of the PRC. Hao Zhang left Skyworks on June 9, 2009 (he had previously suggested to a TJU official that he remain in the U.S. long enough to “master the technology” he was working on at Skyworks). [65] On June 29, 2009, Wei Pang departed Avago and relocated to the PRC. [66] The United States, however, arrested Hao Zhang when, on May 16, 2015, he re-entered the United States. [67] In 2020, Zhang was convicted on charges including economic espionage and theft of trade secrets and ordered to pay nearly half a million dollars in restitution. [68] Insider threats have not only acquired information themselves, they have also made it easier for other PRC threat actors to obtain it. As The Economist noted in 2024, the Chinese Academy of Sciences has filed 192 patents for seeds. [69] Approximately 10 years before this story was filed, Weiqiang Zhang, a Chinese citizen who was in the United States where he had earned his Ph.D. as a legal permanent resident and was employed as a rice breeder for Ventria Bioscience, which produced genetically programmed rice used in therapeutic and medical fields, wrote from his work email, “I try hard to promote scholarly interchange of technology between [the Crops Research Institute in Tianjin, China] researchers and American scholars as well as the scientists from American biotech companies so that we can learn from their advanced technology and use it for our benefit.” [70] Zhang continued that Ventria “is the only biotech company in the U.S. that has the ability to produce and sell recombinant protein products from growing rice seeds. I hope in the near future, Tianjin, China will have the same capability.” [71] Zhang’s letter does not appear to have been idle musing. In 2013, Zhang had helped to coordinate the travel of a PRC crop research delegation to the United States. When the delegation prepared to depart, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) search of its luggage found numerous seeds in envelopes labeled with words or initials that correlated with their contents. An expert rice geneticist employed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture recognized some of these markings as indicating Ventria products. When the FBI subsequently searched Zhang’s home, it discovered two types of seeds in his freezer that were only produced by Ventria and that matched seeds found on the delegation returning to the PRC. [72] In 2017, Zhang was convicted of one count of conspiracy to steal trade secrets (the seeds were patented but the research and protocols used for making them cost-effectively were considered a trade secret), one count of conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. [73] Agricultural espionage by the PRC has yielded indications of an insider threat that has yet to be resolved. Mo Hailong, a PRC national who became a legal U.S. permanent resident via an H-1B visa, was the director of International Business for the Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Company (which had a subsidiary, King’s Nower Seed, responsible for corn seed). Hailong approached the grower of a Pioneer Hi-Bred Corporation test field in Iowa in May 2011 and wanted to know what he was planting. Accompanying Hailong was Wang Lei, the vice chairman of King’s Nower Seed. After learning that the grower was planting corn seed, Hailong returned the following day and began digging in the field before the field manager confronted him. Several months later, Hailong, Lei, and Li Shaoming (a Ph.D. scientist and CEO at Kings Nower Seed) were found at another field in Iowa, which was growing bio-engineered corn seed for Monsanto. Hailong’s activities, according to the FBI, suggested that there were “several potential ‘insiders’ at U.S. based seed companies” who were providing Hailong with locations of test fields being used for growing bio-engineered seed. [74] Although these insiders were not identified, Hailong pled guilty in 2016 to charges of conspiring to steal trade secrets from DuPont (the parent company of Pioneer) and Monsanto. [75] The PRC has also employed insiders with access to targeted companies in furtherance of sophisticated cyberintrusion campaigns. In 2017, a U.S. grand jury indicted participants in a JSSD for a sophisticated attack targeting turbofan engine technology being developed through a partnership between a French firm and a U.S. aerospace company. In 2013, a JSSD intelligence officer (IO) met with Tian Xi, an employee of the French firm, who worked in the firm’s Suzhou, China, office as a product manager. [76] The JSSD provided Xi with malware, which Xi used to infect the firm’s computers using a USB drive. [77] Additionally, the JSSD co-opted the firm’s Information Technology Infrastructure and security manager at the Suzhou office, who provided the JSSD with information about the firm’s internal investigation of the JSSD computer intrusions. [78] Agricultural espionage by the PRC has yielded indications of an insider threat that has yet to be resolved. This JSSD hacking campaign also clearly illustrates how Chinese state hackers could turn companies’ IT infrastructure against themselves. In 2010, members of the conspiracy infiltrated the network of Capstone Turbine—a U.S.-based gas turbine manufacturer—and created an email account on the server (thereby appearing to be legitimate, from within the company) and used it for spear phishing. A member of the conspiracy also installed malware onto Capstone Turbine’s web server to facilitate a “watering hole” attack. This type of attack involves the installation of malware onto legitimate web pages to facilitate intrusions of computers that visit those pages. [79] Several Chinese economic espionage cases have involved the persistent penetrations of U.S. companies, rather than individuals’ illegally facilitated changes in career, which are uniquely damaging. They provide opportunities for PRC entities to remain current on developments within U.S. industry rather than simply acquire increasingly stale stolen material. The Dongfan “Greg” Chung case was a particularly pernicious penetration. Chung was an employee of Rockwell (and later Boeing after it acquired Rockwell) between 1973 and 2002. As early as 1979, Chung volunteered his services to Chen Lung Ku at the PRC’s Harbin Institute of Technology, explaining that Chung had been “a Chinese compatriot for over thirty years” and was “proud of the achievements by the people’s efforts for the motherland.” [80] Chung expressed his regret that he had not contributed anything so far and volunteered his services. It did not take long for Chen to reply, stating, “We’d like to join our hands together with the overseas compatriots in the endeavor for the construction of our great socialist motherland.” [81] This desire to “join our hands together” echoed the relationship between the Chinese in the U.S. Science Association and the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers. Multiple PRC aerospace entities began soliciting assistance from Chung. In 1985, the China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corporation made suggestions for topics that Chung should cover when delivering lectures in the PRC. [82] (Chung provided lectures in the PRC between 1985 and 2003. [83] ) Then, the PRC’s Nan Chang Aircraft Company contacted Chung, who subsequently advised the company that he had started collecting manuals from the Rockwell subsidiary North American Aviation. The PRC clearly viewed Chung as a versatile asset. A third entity, the China Aviation Industry Corporation, contacted Chung in 1987 to ask for technical assistance with several issues, including development of a “space shuttle orbiter.” [84] It was clear that Chung knew he was working for a foreign government. For instance, in 1985, he passed manuals to the Nan Chang Aircraft Company via the Education Consul at the PRC’s San Francisco, California, consulate. [85] Chung was also clearly aware that he was engaged in a clandestine relationship. When a representative of PRC’s Ministry of Aviation and the China Aviation Industry Corporation was making arrangements for one of Chung’s visits to the PRC, the representative suggested “cover stories” that Chung could use to explain his travel. [86] When Chung learned that he was going to be laid off from Boeing, he began to surreptitiously dispose of documents he had collected from the company, hiding them between pages of newspapers, which he recycled. [87] When the FBI searched Chung’s house in 2006, it discovered more than 250,000, pages of documents from Rockwell, Boeing, and other defense contractors both within the house and secreted in a crawl space underneath it. [88] In 2009, a three-week bench trial found Chung guilty of offenses including six counts of economic espionage. [89] Chung’s case was a landmark in the United States’ campaign against the illicit acquisition of corporate information and was the first time that there had been a trial conviction under the 1996 Economic Espionage Act. The PRC’s Ministry of State Security has had a direct role in seeking recruitments in the private sector. Chung, however, would hardly be the last Chinese insider threat engaged in espionage against the U.S. private sector. In 2008, General Electric (GE) hired Xiaoqing Zheng, a dual U.S. and Chinese citizen, as a principal engineer to work on turbine sealing technology. While he was still in the employ of GE, Zheng was selected in 2012 for the PRC’s Thousand Talents program. This should have been a warning sign. Then, in 2014, GE corporate security learned that Zheng had copied 19,020 electronic files from one of his GE-issued computers onto a thumb drive. Zheng’s next step, like his Thousand Talents participation, further suggested that he was trying to bridge two worlds, to GE’s detriment. In 2015, he established the Nanjing Tainyi Aeronautical Technology Ltd. in Nanjing, China. Despite potential conflicts of interest, GE did not tell Zheng that his involvement with the company—a parts supplier for civil aviation engines—was unacceptable. (Subsequently reviewing public Internet sites, GE realized that Zheng was working on the same types of technology for PRC entities that he was for GE.) Zheng, in 2018, used steganography (concealing a data file within another data file) to hide files on his GE computer before emailing them to his personal account. [90] Zheng’s dual life finally came to an end when, in March 2022, a jury trial convicted him of conspiracy to commit economic espionage. Trial evidence showed that Zheng and others in the PRC had conspired to steal GE trade secrets pertaining to ground-based and aviation-based turbine technologies, with the intent to benefit PRC-based companies and universities that research, develop, and manufacture turbine parts. [91] The PRC’s MSS has had a direct role in seeking recruitments in the private sector. Yanjun Xu was a deputy division director in the MSS who was responsible for obtaining trade secrets from aviation and aerospace companies in the United States. The Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA) worked with Xu to target an engineer at GE Aviation. [92] Reaching out via LinkedIn, an NUAA official invited the engineer to deliver a research presentation. [93] Xu’s NUAA coconspirator gave the GE Aviation engineer very specific parameters for the presentation, asking him to focus on highly technical topics including the latest developments in the application of GE Aviation’s signature material used in aeroengines, as well as engine structure design analysis technology and manufacturing technology development. The PRC had used a similar methodology with Chung. Although the email was signed by an NUAA official, it came from one of Xu’s email accounts. [94] The presentation allowed Xu to surface and take over the relationship from NUAA. An NUAA official made the introduction between Xu and the engineer, wherein Xu presented himself as being affiliated with the Jiangsu Science and Technology Association. During the first few months of 2018, Xu and the engineer corresponded with Xu raising the possibility of the engineer returning to NUAA; in January 2018, he advised the engineer that he was consulting with the department to identify which technology was of interest. Shortly thereafter, Xu broached the idea of meeting with the engineer during a business trip to Europe. In preparation for this, Xu asked the engineer to export a GE Aviation file directory onto a hard drive. Xu’s expectation that he would be running an ongoing penetration of GE Aviation was apparent in his suggestion that this meeting would not be the last one, since they would be doing business together. [95] It was, however, the last one. When Xu arrived in Belgium, expecting to receive information from his GE Aviation source, authorities arrested him and extradited him to the United States, where he became the first MSS officer to stand trial in a U.S. courtroom. [96] The PRC, in addition to recruiting insider threats, has used U.S.-based platforms to hire expertise from which it then siphons trade secrets and other protected information. These platforms include businesses formed in the United States that serve as intermediaries for recruiting specific talents. They also take the form of PRC subsidiaries that have established a presence within the United States. China’s pursuit of the ability to produce titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) via a chloride route eventually used a U.S.-based consulting firm to acquire trade secrets. TiO 2 is a white pigment used in a wide variety of products ranging from paints to food (it is, among other things, what gives Oreo filling its color). E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (DuPont) invented the chloride route process—which consists of multiple trade secrets—to manufacture TiO 2 in the 1940s. [97] The PRC was intent on acquiring chloride route TiO 2 technology, having publicly identified it as a scientific and economic priority. [98] In the early 1990s, the Chinese government attempted to purchase TiO 2 technology from DuPont in furtherance of building its own plant. DuPont was charging $75 million to license its technology and the PRC opted, for the time being, to pursue a TiO 2 production method developed in the former Soviet Union. Starting in 2000, DuPont began exploring the possibility of building its own TiO 2 plant in China and, by 2007, it had obtained some of the government approvals for the project. By 2008, however, the project had stalled because DuPont could no longer get information about the project’s status from government officials. [99] What DuPont did not know was that the PRC had not been deterred by DuPont’s uninterest. In 1991, Walter Liew attended a banquet hosted by high-level PRC officials who identified him as “a patriotic overseas Chinese” who had provided the PRC with “key technologies.” [100] At this banquet, the secretary general of China’s State Council gave Liew “directives” about future contributions he could make to the PRC. Liew subsequently received a list of “key task[s]” that identified chloride route TiO 2 production as one of the “more important projects.” [101] Liew was a businessman. In the 1990s, he and his wife founded USA Performance Technology Inc (UAPTI), a provider of engineering consulting services. [102] Liew, in 1997, met two former DuPont employees, Robert Maegerle and Tim Spitler, a project engineer and chemical engineer, respectively, who had experience with TiO 2 facilities. When these individuals retired from DuPont, they agreed “not to use or divulge … any secret or confidential information” without DuPont’s permission. [103] By early 1998, Liew had assembled a team of former DuPont employees, under USAPTI’s direction. It did not take long for this team to begin passing proprietary information. In March 1998, Maegerle sent a fax to Liew that contained DuPont TSI as well as information about plant costs and personnel data, the latter of which would be useful to a company trying to develop facilities to compete with DuPont. Maegerle continued to provide Liew and USAPTI with DuPont trade secrets into 2010. [104] The PRC government was still interested in acquiring TiO2 chloride route technology. China’s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) controlled the Pangang Group Company Limited. When Liew learned that one of Pangang’s subsidiaries planned to build a 30,000 metric tons per year (MTPY) TiO2 chloride process plant, he wrote letters, advising that he possessed the complete TiO 2 process technology and attempted to sell his services to Pangang. In 2005, Liew signed a $6.2 million with one of Pangang’s subsidiaries to develop a 30,000 metric-ton-per-year TiO 2 project. He followed this up in 2009 by signing a $17.8 million contract with another Pangang subsidiary for a 100,000 metric-ton-per-year TiO 2 project. In August 2009, USAPTI delivered design information to Pangang that contained numerous features based on technology directly misappropriated from DuPont. [105] Pursuit of TiO 2 shows that the use of U.S. platforms to gather proprietary information was not limited to Liew’s dealings with Pangang. Tze Chao had been a DuPont employee between 1966 and 2002 before becoming a consultant to the Pangang Group in 2003. Chao bid against USAPTI for the 2009 contract that the latter won. [106] In the course of the ultimately unsuccessful negotiations, the Pangang Group agreed that it would work with Chao’s firm Cierra if it employed former DuPont employees and possessed blueprints for DuPont’s TiO 2 plants. [107] It is worth noting that a Pangang Group official asked Chao to review the work that USAPTI had provided, in 2009, approximately a month after USAPTI provided it. [108] Chao provided a report to Pangang, with recommendations for improving USAPTI’s designs; these recommendations drew on DuPont’s trade secrets. [109] Liew’s prosecution was a landmark in economic espionage law. It was the first time a federal jury had convicted on charges brought under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996. [110] In 2014, Liew received a 15-year sentence and was ordered to forfeit $278 million in illegal profits and pay $511,687.82 in restitution for what the judge described as a “white collar crime spree.” [111] Chao had already pled guilty in 2012 to conspiracy to commit economic espionage. [112] The PRC used a similar approach to acquire nuclear technology. Szuhsiung Ho was the owner and president of Delaware-based Energy Technology International (ETI) and served as a senior advisor to the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Company (CGNPC). The CGNPC is a state-owned enterprise controlled by SASAC, with a board of directors composed of Communist Party of China members. [113] (SASAC also controlled Pangang, which had used a similar playbook to acquire chloride route TiO 2 technology.) Ho and ETI engaged in talent acquisition on behalf of CGNPC. Ho, in October 2009, indicated that “China has the budget to spend. They asked me if I could form a comprehensive team to provide technology transfer in design and manufacturing, related training, and technical supports.” [114] According to Ho, CGNPC wanted to “bypass the research stage and go directly to the final design and manufacturing phase.” [115] It was apparent that Ho was targeting expertise in a specific U.S. company. In December 2009, he recruited multiple U.S. persons (USPERs) to assist CGNPC with its fuel design program. In his pitch, he indicated that he was interested in retired or active employees from a specific U.S. company, but cautioned, “Please help but do not openly announce this news. I don’t want to alert [the U.S. company].” [116] Ho made a similar pitch in early 2012, when he sought assistance in recruiting small modular reactor experts and asked an individual to “spread the words to your [U.S. company] colleagues (current or retired colleagues) but without revealing CGNPC intention to build such reactors.” [117] It was apparent that the U.S. company was at risk of losing information. In April 2012, Ho recruited a third USPER from the company who later advised that the USPER would be able to give CGNPC useful information that was not in the normal company presentations. [118] Ho’s actions were not economic espionage per se, but were a similar movement of restricted information from the U.S. private sector to a PRC government-controlled entity. In 2016, a federal grand jury indicted Ho on a charge of conspiring to engage or participate in the development or production of special nuclear material in China without specific authorization to do so from the U.S. secretary of Energy. [119] The grand jury also indicted Ho on a charge of acting as a foreign agent. [120] Ho pled guilty to the special nuclear material charge and was sentenced to 24 months in prison. [121] Had he been convicted of the foreign agent charge, he would have faced a potential life sentence. [122] A variation on the theme of U.S. companies funneling talent illicitly to the PRC is the employment of USPERs by U.S. elements of Chinese technology firms. For instance, Baidu—a Chinese firm that has become heavily involved with artificial intelligence (AI)—has sought to tap Silicon Valley expertise by establishing its first office there in 2011 and following that up in 2017 by establishing an R&D center. [123] Baidu’s announcement of its R&D center illustrates how China can tap into U.S. talent to support innovation by companies ultimately beholden to Beijing. In 2014, the company announced that the center was to be led by an individual who had previously helmed Stanford University’s AI lab and had also helped Google establish its own AI efforts. [124] It is a short step for an individual once hired by a Chinese firm to furnish trade secrets, whether intentionally or simply by incorporation of knowledge into work product, from a previous employers. The PRC has taken an aggressive position in the South China Sea. Consistent with this, it has sought to develop marine engineering equipment that could survive at significant depths. This led the PRC to identify the need for a material called syntactic foam. In furtherance of conducting research on this material, PRC government entities, including three state-owned enterprises, partnered with the Taizhou CBM Future New Material Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (CBMF) in China’s Zhejiang Province. CBMF planned to sell syntactic foam to the PRC military and state owned enterprises. [125] Acquisition of syntactic foam technology bore resemblances to the Walter Liew and Szuhsiung Ho cases. The difference is that the U.S.-based entity siphoning local talent was directly controlled by the PRC. Shan Shi became president of CBM International (CBMI), which was established in Houston, Texas, during 2014. CBMF was the only shareholder in CBMI and Shan Shi was, in turn, a shareholder of CBMF who had been involved with the design of at least one PLA Navy ship. [126] Shi had pledged to build “China’s first deep[-]sea drilling buoyance [ sic ] material production line” based on what he could “digest / absorb” from the United States. [127] Business arrangements that span the United States and the PRC have been conduits for the siphoning of autonomous vehicle technology. CBMI hired, directly and indirectly, individuals who had worked for the Swedish company Trelleborg Offshore, with a subsidiary in Houston, Texas, that focused on development of syntactic foam. Samuel Ogoe had been employed by the Swedish company before going to work for CBMI. In 2015, Ogoe was in contact with multiple employees of Trelleborg Offshore who provided Ogoe with three trade secrets. Information about at least one of these secrets went from Ogoe to another CBMI employee to CBMF. Shi used another firm, Offshore Drilling Inc. (ODI), which he owned, as a cover for recruiting additional expertise. Greg Liu was a Chinese citizen who had arrived in the United States on a student visa. (This status brings to mind the origins of the threats to Avago and Skyworks.) Eventually, Liu obtained employment with Trelleborg Offshore as a material development engineer. After Liu was laid off from that job, Shi offered Liu full-time employment at ODI to conceal the work that Liu would be doing for CBMI from Trelleborg Offshore. Liu provided CBMI and CBMF personnel with four additional trade secrets while employed by ODI. In June 2016, Shi dropped the charade and transferred Liu to CBMI. [128] In 2019, Shi was convicted on one count of conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets. [129] He received a 16-month prison sentence and was ordered to forfeit more than $330,000. [130] Business arrangements that span the United States and the PRC have been conduits for the siphoning of autonomous vehicle technology. In 2015, TuSimple, a self-driving-truck developer, began operations in 2015, in California. [131] The company was founded by two Chinese entrepreneurs and backed by a Chinese media mogul. (In the authoritarian PRC, it is difficult to believe that media strays too far from the government’s line.) TuSimple developed technology in the United States. This problem was similar to that presented by Baidu’s and Huawei’s leveraging of U.S. talent. Some of this technology was developed in conjunction with American companies such as Navistar. [132] TuSimple was intertwined with PRC-based entities. After establishing TuSimple, one of its co-founders established a PRC-located startup in 2021 called Hydron—which develops hydrogen-powered trucks—backed by the same mogul who had backed TuSimple. [133] Hydron recruited TuSimple employees, with some continuing to work for the former company. [134] The two companies shared an office in Beijing. TuSimple employees working in the Beijing office routinely downloaded autonomy source code, via joint access to a repository, developed by U.S.-based engineers. [135] These ostensibly private companies had links to the PRC government. In 2021, Hydron, which was informed by TuSimple’s technology, reached a deal to develop autonomous trucks with Foton, a Chinese company. Foton was a subsidiary of Beijing Automotive Group Co., Ltd. (BAIC), a PRC state-owned company. BAIC had an agreement with a Chinese military university that was doing work on driverless technology. [136] Subsidiaries of Chinese companies operating in the United States can facilitate the illicit transfer of knowledge through employment. In 2018, for instance, Xiaolang Zhang, who was hired by Apple to work on an autonomous vehicle project, downloaded trade secret intellectual property shortly before departing the company to take a position with Xiaopeng Motors, a Chinese electric vehicle company, which had offices in Palo Alto, California. According to Zhang, he planned to work for the Chinese competitor on the same technologies that he had developed for Apple. [137] Zhang, in 2022, pled guilty to one count of theft of trade secrets. [138] It is worth noting that Zhang’s case was one of three Chinese cases that targeted Apple’s autonomous car project. [139] The PRC’s massive telecommunications company, Huawei, has capitalized on its U.S. presence. Another one of the Apple penetrations highlights the threat that companies such as Baidu pose. In 2016, Apple hired Weibao Wang as a software engineer. Wang worked on the Apple team that designed and developed hardware and software that had applications for self-driving cars. In late 2017, Wang accepted an offer of full-time employment as a staff engineer with the U.S.-based subsidiary of a PRC company that was working on self-driving car technology. Wang waited for more than four months before advising Apple that he had accepted a new position. This gap could give Wang time to learn what his new employer wanted to know from Apple. In the days leading up to his departure from Apple, in April 2018, Wang accessed large amounts of sensitive proprietary and confidential information. [140] Wang then fled the United States for Guangzhou, China. [141] Once in the PRC, he became an executive at a joint venture between Baidu and Chinese automaker Geely. [142] If Baidu was willing to employ an individual accused of trade secret theft in the PRC, what was it doing much closer to U.S. tech firms in Silicon Valley? The PRC’s massive telecommunications company, Huawei, has capitalized on its U.S. presence. It has a facility in Plano, Texas, and an R&D center in Northern California. [143] The company has weaponized recruitment against U.S. firms. Shortly after the founding of one U.S. company (referred to in a 2020 indictment as “Company 6”), which was poised to compete directly against Huawei in the field of memory hardware architectural design, Huawei launched an initiative to continuously recruit employees of Company 6 to cause “internal turmoil” at its competitor. [144] Even more perniciously, Huawei has functioned as a de facto intelligence service. In 2013, it launched a bonus program to reward employees who obtained confidential information from competitors. There was a formal rewards schedule to pay employees of Huawei affiliates based on the value of information they obtained. Employees who acquired information of interest were supposed to post it to an internal Huawei website or, if it was particularly sensitive, send it via encrypted email to a special “huawei.com” email inbox. [145] Huawei’s activities in the field of joint ventures show how the PRC has subverted business norms to achieve an unfair advantage vis-à-vis U.S. competitors. In 2009, the Huawei subsidiary Futurewei targeted a technology company (referred to in a USG indictment as “Company 4”) for technology related to antennas that provide cellular telephone and data services. Futurewei approached this through the guise of a joint venture. In September 2009, Futurewei entered into a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with Company 4, which was supposed to prevent Futurewei from using any of Company 4’s confidential information to Futurewei’s benefit or to the competitive disadvantage of Company 4. Futurewei received TSI from Company 4 in late September 2009. It took Futurewei only approximately a month to file a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that relied in large part on Company 4’s intellectual property. [146] Chinese economic espionage and economic espionage-adjacent cases at least partially debunk a widely repeated generalization about PRC spying. Paul Moore, who intelligence historian David Wise characterized as the FBI’s “former senior China analyst,” for instance, characterized Chinese intelligence collection as consisting of numerous individuals, each collecting small amounts of information, equivalent to tourists picking up grains of sand on a beach, rather than targeting specific items. [147] Another former FBI official, I.C. Smith, testified to the U.S. China Economic and Security Commission that “there is, often times, little specific targeting of information or technology by the Chinese.” [148] The PRC, however, has engaged in what appears to be targeted collection against several technologies, consistent with the objectives it has articulated. Multi-person targeting of specific technologies (e.g., the 2018 thefts of Apple autonomous vehicle technology—consistent with the Made in China 2025 objective of developing high-end computerized machines) suggests that collection is coordinated. Relatedly, the case of CBMI indicates that collection is not opportunistic. The PRC identified a technology it wanted (again consistent with a Made in China 2025 objective—new materials) and developed a specific intelligence operation to obtain it. Furthermore, the PRC has taken a multi-vector approach to obtain information on specific topics: PRC actors attacked U.S. turbine technology through both human and technical penetrations. The JSSD compromised the network of Capstone Turbine. Several years later, Zheng Xiaoqing engaged in theft from GE. The private sector needs to maintain a robust analytic capability to ferret out threats and address vulnerabilities. While cybersecurity is the hottest topic, it is the lowest hanging fruit. Companies need to start with geopolitical analysis of the PRC’s objectives and assess how China may seek to enhance its capabilities through espionage. It then needs to identify its own vulnerabilities to human, as well as technical, penetrations and take steps to harden these areas. This should be informed by maintaining an ongoing awareness of the methodologies and tactics PRC actors use, such as the establishment of U.S. firms that siphon expertise that is then transmitted to Chinese state-affiliated entities. Industry can benefit from partnering with the government, but it should also be maintaining or acquiring its own intelligence capabilities. Government has historically proven to be a valuable partner in developing counterintelligence awareness, and the private sector’s position as the first target of economic espionage means that it is uniquely positioned to be a good corporate citizen by providing authorities with its observations. Government priorities, however, do change as the United States deals with what it deems to be the most pressing national security issues. The FBI, for instance, has historically, on multiple occasions, shifted resources away from counterintelligence. In 1992, under the mistaken impression that the Cold War had conclusively ended, the Bureau reassigned approximately 300 agents from counterintelligence to investigating violent crime. [149] This reassessment led to the creation of the Safe Streets Task Forces. More recently, as at the end of the Cold War in 1991, the FBI—consistent with the White House’s prioritization—has identified the need to “crush violent crime” as an objective. [150] Consistent with this, in August 2025, the FBI’s Washington Field Office reassigned agents from areas including counterintelligence to work against local criminal activities in Washington, D.C. [151] Addressing illegal migration has also led to a reprioritization of resources. In October 2025, The Washington Post reported, based on data obtained by Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), that the Bureau had reassigned approximately 25 percent of its total agents to immigration enforcement (with the largest field offices dedicating more than 40 percent of their allotment to this challenge). [152] Some of these agents were drawn from the fields of counterintelligence and cybercrime. [153] While it is the administration’s prerogative to assess threats and how best to address them, counterintelligence, particularly combating economic espionage and trade secret theft, is an essential mission that should be maintained and adequately resourced. A desire to do more with less may also diminish the U.S. government’s ability to assist the private sector. For instance, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) lost approximately 1,000 employees to buyouts and layoffs during the first few months of the second Trump administration. [154] A significant CISA function, often in collaboration with the FBI, is warning the private sector about network vulnerabilities. Such awareness helps to get in front of PRC cyberactors before they can exploit information technology systems to pilfer private sector secrets. Another DHS component, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) plays a sometimes-overlooked role in combating Chinese theft against the U.S. private sector. For instance, between 2011 and 2013, Wenxia Man conspired to illegally export multiple fighter jet engines and an MQ-9 drone to China. [155] (The aerospace sector is one of the 10 identified in the Made in China 2025 plan. [156] ) It was an undercover HSI agent who learned, from Man, that her coconspirator Xinsheng Zhang, located in the PRC, was a “technology spy” who worked on behalf of the Chinese military to copy purloined items. [157] The second Trump administration, according to the Cato Institute, has opted to reorient HSI agents from their investigatory activities to focus on immigration enforcement. [158] Cuts to government spending may impose a “brain drain” on the private sector. Technology companies’ R&D has historically received support from the U.S. government, so reductions in spending may lead firms to downsize and lay off human capital. China continues to pursue cutting-edge technology that has been developed in the private sector. For instance, in 2023, a Google employee working on AI applied to a Chinese talent program and founded his own company in the PRC. [159] The United States is already seeing China attempting to recruit former U.S. government scientists with opportunities for career development. [160] If the private sector follows suit and downsizes due to a reduction in government spending, China may employ similar techniques against laid off personnel. Limited resources mean that the U.S. government should focus on preemption rather than investigation. Chinese economic espionage is an ecosystem, and measures can be taken to strategically disrupt it. The porousness between Chinese academic institutions and the PRC government has proven to be an ongoing problem. The United States in 2025 announced that it would start revoking visas of Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. [161] This should be supplemented. Multiple cases have highlighted specific Chinese schools whose students have been linked to the theft of trade secrets and proprietary information. The United States should blacklist these Chinese institutions and reject their students’ visa applications . China is using the United States’ capacity for innovation against it. PRC companies including tech heavyweights Baidu and Huawei have engaged in R&D in the United States. The presence of such firms amounts to helping Beijing innovate against Washington. Currently, despite the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is still not able to block certain types of greenfield investments (i.e., nonacquisition) that would empower a foreign adversary such as China. At the same time, both Chinese firms and government venture funds invest in U.S. technology company startups and are usually able to avoid CFIUS scrutiny. New CFIUS legislation should set parameters—and impose meaningful oversight—on the type of activities that Chinese companies operating within the United States can engage in. The U.S. Intelligence Community is essential to identifying foreign developments that will inform economic espionage. For instance, determining Chinese geopolitical objectives will help the United States to understand what capabilities it needs and what it will likely target. The President’s Intelligence Priorities (PIP), conveyed through the National Intelligence Priorities Framework (NIPF), inform “resource allocations to ensure collection and analysis of intelligence that provides insights, warning or other illuminating information on the priorities.” [162] The NIPF in turn translates and implements national intelligence priorities “to ensure the IC is focusing its collection, analysis, and operational resources on the most urgent and important national security issues.” [163] Topics that help the United States forecast trends in economic espionage and trade secret theft by the PRC should be incorporated into the PIP and cascading NIPF if they are not already included. Multiple topics can help the U.S. government to disrupt economic espionage and trade secret theft before these manifest themselves in specific crimes that harm the private sector. Collection should include Chinese innovation strategies such as the Made in China 2025 plan; geopolitical objectives including a focus on the South China Sea that new capabilities such as syntactic foam might support; relationships with third countries through which China might already be obtaining technology; China’s intelligence services’ methodologies and tactics; and security vulnerabilities in U.S. industry’s business practice. Analysis should turn this data into an awareness of how these variables might interplay to create risks and, from there, provide recommendations for solutions. Ultimately, the PRC-U.S. contest over technology secrets is not trench warfare, but rather a continually evolving fight. PRC objectives will continue to change, as their geopolitical objectives shift, and this will inform its targeting of specific industries, companies, and technologies. Changes in how the countries interact—both in the human and technical spaces—will shape intelligence methodologies and tradecraft. The U.S. government’s ability to disrupt economic espionage—especially through preemptive, strategic measures—will mitigate risk to industry. Finally, U.S. industry’s investment in its own protection—analysis of geopolitics cascading into ramifications for intelligence that informs countermeasures—will be essential to the protection of its assets.

How Some Chinese Companies Obscure Ties to China and What Policymakers Should Do About It Key Takeaways Introduction False Flag Company Examples Understanding Patterns of Chinese Economic Obfuscation Policy Recommendations Conclusion Endnotes,2025-11-03,Eli Clemens,"Certain Chinese companies obscure their ownership and strategic intent in the U.S. economy, gaining access to markets, talent, intellectual property, and subsidies. These practices advance China’s industrial and military goals and necessitate stronger oversight measures. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 3 False Flag Company Examples 4 Understanding Patterns of Chinese Economic Obfuscation . 17 Policy Recommendations 19 Conclusion . 22 Endnotes 23 Since the 1990s, China’s government has pushed its companies to “go out”: to compete internationally, capture market share, and leverage the benefits of globalization in talent and supply chains. [1] The Belt and Road Initiative, launched in 2013, has intensified this push. [2] An understudied part of this campaign is how China’s government has recommended Chinese companies to “adhere to cultural integration [and] actively adapt to host country culture” when operating abroad. [3] In its 2017 “Report on Development of China’s Outward Investment and Economic Cooperation,” China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) instructed all Chinese multinationals that “internationalization must be accompanied by localization.” [4] What MOFCOM frames as “localization” goes far beyond business school teachings on adapting products and management practices to foreign markets. In the same report, MOFCOM explained that in order to localize, a firm should “downplay the company’s home-country identity.” [5] This definition of localization has become widely adopted in Chinese academia, industry associations, and the private sector. [6] For example, the Chinese modular building company Shihang Holdings states on its English-facing website that it deliberately “dilute[s] the company’s home country color” as part of its localization business strategy. [7] In practice, this obfuscation has become nefarious: Certain Chinese companies operating in the United States mask their national origin, presenting themselves as American corporate citizens—sometimes complete with patriotic branding—even while Beijing retains ultimate control over their ownership and strategic direction. The result is favorable to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP): these obscured companies benefit from their obfuscation by gaining privileged access to the U.S. market, intellectual property (IP), talent, and even generous U.S. government funding to support China’s strategic industrial and military priorities. Certain Chinese companies operating in the United States mask their national origin, presenting themselves as American corporate citizens—sometimes complete with patriotic branding—even while Beijing retains ultimate control over their ownership and strategic direction. This report features three case studies of U.S.-based Chinese companies operating in the strategic sectors of aerospace, construction machinery, and advanced batteries that obscure their ties to China. Together, they reveal a larger pattern: The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC’s) industrial strategy encourages embedded footholds within the U.S. economy through a deliberate, state-directed strategy of obfuscation. The case studies bring to mind the famous line attributed to Lenin that “the capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.” [8] The fact that the U.S. government would subsidize these obscured companies is alarming. Meanwhile, U.S. companies operating in China face limits on market share, restricted access to government procurement, constraints on talent recruitment, and mandatory technology transfers. [9] China would never allow a U.S. military supplier to acquire a strategically critical Chinese company, rebrand it to appear Chinese, and receive extensive subsidies from China’s government—the reverse of a case study detailed in this report. While the openness of the U.S. economy is a strength, it also creates vulnerabilities that the PRC is deliberately exploiting, just as it has exploited the U.S. open scientific system. [10] To mitigate risks from obfuscated Chinese companies, the United States should recalibrate its approach through the following policy changes. The stakes are no lower than safeguarding U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and national security. 1. Congress should strengthen Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS) screening and oversight. 2. Congress should expand Chinese ownership disclosure requirements. 3. The National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA) and CFIUS should block Chinese companies in the United States from advancing PRC military capabilities. 4. Federal agencies, in coordination with CFIUS, should block U.S. subsidies to PRC-financed companies. 5. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should clarify brand obfuscation practices. 6. Federal agencies, overseen by Congress’s intelligence committees, should create a centralized due diligence database and CFIUS should integrate trade enforcement intelligence into their screens. The following case studies illustrate what this report terms a “false flag company”: a firm that presents itself as American but is ultimately owned by a Chinese company that itself is either state owned or has significant ties to the PLA. CAT’s website presents itself as an all-American company, proudly displaying a red, white, and blue eagle logo, as seen in figure 1. [11] Indeed, the aviation engine company has a patriotic history. Parent company Continental Motors Company spun it out as a subsidiary named Continental Aircraft Engine Company in 1927. [12] During World War II, Continental companies built engines for U.S. aircraft, tanks, and other combat vehicles. [13] Today, CAT’s website still highlights its contributions to the Navy’s storied Grasshopper Fleet in the 1940s. [14] Figure 1 : Continental Aerospace Technologies’ logo , 2025 [15] Yet, by the early 21st century, CAT faced significant challenges. In the 1960s, Teledyne Technologies had acquired Continental Motors Company, including its subsidiaries, renaming the consolidated company Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM). [16] After the 2008 recession, TCM cut costs due to “reduced demand,” and in 2010, Teledyne Technologies sold TCM to Technify Motor (USA) for $186 million. [17] The deal transferred TCM’s Alabama and New York plants and approximately 400 employees to the new owner. [18] Despite the “USA” in its name, Technify Motor (USA) was a Chinese company. [19] Its parent, the state-owned aerospace and defense company Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), had registered the subsidiary to acquire TCM. [20] Because the buyer was foreign, the transaction required a CFIUS review. [21] CFIUS approved the transaction, leading to a 2013 academic conclusion from Amrietha Nellan that “the CFIUS review is not politically hostile against all Chinese investors.” [22] Teledyne Technologies framed the sale as an opportunity that “allows Teledyne to focus on its core businesses” and “will allow Continental Motors to continue to be a global leader in the general aviation piston engine industry.” [23] CAT’s website explained AVIC’s acquisition as “strengthening the company’s market access” (as seen in figure 2), but did not explicitly highlight AVIC’s Chinese ownership. [24] Figure 2: Continental Aerospace Technologies’ website detailing AVIC’s 2011 acquisition [25] Commentary from Robert Goyer of FLYING Magazine in a 2010 article titled “A Sad Day? Continental Motors Sold to Chinese Firm” offered a sharper perspective, warning, “It’s hard to imagine Chinese owners keep all manufacturing in Alabama to support an emerging aviation movement on their home turf.” [26] Yet, nearly 15 years later, CAT continues to manufacture piston aircraft engines in Alabama. [27] And under AVIC’s control, CAT launched its current logo in 2019, saying that it was “signaling a new chapter of excellence.” [28] By highlighting CAT’s long-standing contributions to U.S. aviation, AVIC has used marketing to emphasize CAT’s storied American legacy while obscuring its Chinese ownership. Yet, according to limited access to WireScreen’s China-focused business intelligence platform, China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC), which governs its state-owned enterprises, owns 100 percent of AVIC and 46.4 percent of CAT. [29] With CAT in hand, China—largely through AVIC—is now on track to achieve three goals within the piston aircraft engine sector. The first goal is achieving supply chain independence in piston engine development. China’s “Made in China 2025” plan directs local governments and agencies to “establish an independent industrial system for engine development.” [30] Following its 2011 acquisition of CAT, AVIC successfully produced China’s first domestically developed horizontally opposed piston engine in 2013, “filling a gap in [China’s] general aviation power sector.” [31] As one Chinese aerospace company noted in 2016, AVIC’s purchase of CAT directly launched “China’s domestic development strategy for aviation piston engines.” [32] MOFCOM’s China Aviation Industry Development Research Center wrote contemporaneously that AVIC’s acquisition of CAT “represents a major step by AVIC International in implementing [its] strategy to ‘integrate into the global aviation supply chain.’” [33] Building on that, China’s second goal is to increase its global market share in the piston aircraft engine industry. It accounted for approximately 14.8 percent of global production capacity as of 2023, according to an industry estimate, though China’s government likely has aspirations to further expand. [34] The third goal extends beyond market access and commercial competition. The Department of Defense (DOD) has identified AVIC as a dual-use company that “designs and produces PRC’s military aircraft,” while the Air Force’s China Aerospace Studies Institute has described AVIC “as if Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Sikorsky, at least parts of Boeing and Raytheon, and essentially all other domestic aviation companies were all subsidiaries of a single corporation.” [35] CAT is key to AVIC’s dual-use ambitions in the current era of modern warfare that relies heavily upon unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). [36] In a 2016 article titled “Development Status and Trends of Advanced Power Systems for High-end Combat UAVs at Home and Abroad,” Chengdu Aerospace Superalloy Technology, which according to WireScreen is a defense supplier, wrote that “in the next few years, domestic high-end unmanned combat aircraft will be able to use domestically developed power systems,” and attributed that accomplishment in part to AVIC’s acquisition of CAT. [37] A 2022 article by a frequent commenter on China’s military highlights AVIC’s acquisition of CAT in conjunction with “years of digestion and absorption” that has successfully led to China’s successful development of a heavy fuel oil piston aircraft engine industry, which allows Chinese drones “to fly at higher altitudes, have a longer flight time, and carry a heavier payload.” [38] China’s domestically-produced SAIC LE-500 Xiaoying light aircraft, which has an armed military variant, allegedly uses CAT piston diesel engines. [39] The U.S. government has taken steps to limit risk exposure to AVIC’s status as a PLA supplier. A 2020 executive order prohibits U.S. persons from investing in securities of companies tied to the Chinese military, which the Department of the Treasury’s (USDT’s) Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) enforces through its Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies (NS-CMIC) list, to which it added AVIC—and therefore its subsidiary CAT—in 2021. [40] Additionally, DOD included AVIC on its Section 1260H list in the NDAA for Fiscal Year (FY) 2021, which identifies Chinese military companies operating in the United States and works in conjunction with other laws that limit or prohibit government procurement and other engagements with listed companies. [41] Yet, the U.S. government imposes few restrictions on CAT itself. Following its acquisition by AVIC, the company operates under Federal Aviation Administration regulations and can acquire other U.S. aerospace companies. [42] In 2013, CAT acquired Germany’s bankrupt Thielert Aircraft Engines, which supplied engines for the Gray Eagle Unmanned Aircraft System—a key component of the U.S. Army’s Aviation Modernization Plan. [43] Notably, Thielert Aircraft Engines’ lead engineer has ties to Beihang University, one of China’s “Seven Sons of National Defense.” [44] Research companies including Datenna and BluePath Labs have flagged risks that AVIC’s acquisition of CAT present, but they only scratch the surface. [45] For example, although CAT cannot undertake U.S. defense work due to DOD listing AVIC on its Section 1260H list, the company likely faces no barriers in hiring personnel with security clearances or defense experience. An August 2025 job posting for a senior engineer III sought a candidate who “approaches all engineering work with a security lens” and could “actively look for security vulnerabilities including protection of intellectual property, import and export compliance.” [46] In 2020, the Small Business Administration awarded CAT with a $7.43 million Paycheck Protection Program loan, which was later fully forgiven. CAT’s Mobile, Alabama location gives the company access to a hub of aerospace talent. [47] Mobile’s University of South Alabama, Coastal Alabama Community College’s Alabama Aviation Center (AAC), and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s Mobile sites offer aerospace programs and Reserve Officers’ Training Corps opportunities. [48] While many of the United States’ future aerospace engineers receive their education in Mobile, that talent does not all go to U.S. aerospace companies, U.S. allies’ companies, or the U.S. military. [49] Instead, some of that talent goes to CAT, which actively engages with Mobile’s aerospace-focused education institutions by offering free planes to AAC, hiring students as interns, organizing its own Aviation Technician Advanced Training Program, and lobbying in its interests, for example publicly calling on the University of South Alabama to design a new supply chain major in part because it “would greatly improve the skill sets of Continental.” [50] CAT has also engaged with other U.S. aerospace hubs not necessarily near Mobile, such as donating to a state government-backed aviation program in Tennessee. [51] In return, CAT ensures a pipeline of skilled employees: For example, AAC lists CAT as one of many “leaders in the aviation industry” in the area that needs “trained, reliable employees to keep their operations moving.” [52] CAT shares Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley—which was previously a U.S. Air Force base—with U.S. defense suppliers such as Airbus, Safran, and MAAS Aviation, as well as military users including the National Guard, Army Reserves, Marine Corps Reserves, and Coast Guard. [53] Given China’s history of targeting U.S. aviation companies for IP and military secrets, this location provides AVIC with potential access to sensitive industrial and human resources. [54] Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike has suggested that AVIC has “benefited significantly from the cyber efforts of the MSS [Ministry of State Security].” [55] CAT also potentially provides China’s intelligence apparatus with an opportunity to collect intelligence on U.S. aerospace talent. China’s 2017 National Intelligence Law obligates organizations and citizens to support national intelligence work, which could require CAT to provide information on current or former employees of interest. [56] For example, one former CAT engineer who worked at the company both before and following its AVIC acquisition later assumed senior roles at U.S. defense contractors including SpaceX and Raytheon. [57] AVIC can also access U.S. government funding and support through CAT’s continued presence in the United States. The Alabama Department of Commerceassisted CAT in building a new $75 million facility to produce piston and turbine engines and parts for light aircraft in 2018, and selected CAT as a recipient for a Governor’s Trade Excellence Award in 2022. [58] The Illinois state comptroller approved in 2021 a $78,000 contract of educational funding to go to CAT. [59] In 2020, the Small Business Administration (SBA) awarded CAT with a $7.43 million Paycheck Protection Program loan, which was later fully forgiven. [60] Post-AVIC acquisition, CAT employs U.S. workers, pays taxes, manufactures goods for U.S. export, and engages with local institutions. [61] But its operational structure and branding obscure its Chinese ownership, granting AVIC—and, by extension, China’s government and military—substantial strategic and competitive advantages in the aerospace sector. Figure 3: Early Swedish hydraulic lift, 1929 [62] In 1920s Sweden, cities installed hydraulic lifts on vehicles so workers could safely change streetlights, as seen in figure 3. [63] Over the decades, this technology evolved into boom and scissor lifts, forming today’s aerial work platforms (AWPs) industry—machines that provide safe access to elevated work areas for construction, industrial, and military applications. [64] By the 1970s, U.S. companies were building larger, taller, and more innovative AWPs, setting global standards. [65] Today, one of the United States’ leading AWP manufacturers calls itself “MEC Aerial Work Platforms.” [66] It traces its roots back to Mayville Engineering Company (MEC), a legacy American brand supplying components for commercial vehicles, data centers, and military platforms. [67] MEC has long supplied the U.S. defense sector with assemblies for tactical wheeled and military vehicles. [68] In 1976, MEC began producing AWPs, and by 2004, another company acquired MEC’s AWP arm and renamed it California Manufacturing & Engineering Company (CMEC). [69] Between 2016 and 2024, Chinese AWP manufacturer Zhejiang Dingli Machinery Co., Ltd. (Dingli) took control of CMEC. Dingli, whose AWP product lineup is pictured in figure 4, became a supplier to CMEC in 2016, then bought a 25 percent stake in 2018. [70] At the time, Dingli described its rationale: “America is the originator and headstream of aerial working platform, which has the world-class access equipment manufacturers. Therefore, the door is shut upon the face of foreign products of the same kind which want to enter the American market in most cases.” [71] Dingli raised its ownership to 49.8 percent in 2023 and ultimately acquired the remaining 50.2 percent in 2024. [72] Reporting of Dingli’s acquisition of CMEC suggests that the transactions were private-share sales instead of open market purchases. [73] The Chinese law firm working with Dingli, Dacheng Law Offices, stated in a 2024 news release that the acquisition was “approved by CFIUS within a relatively short period of time.” [74] Figure 4: Dingli’s AWP product lineup [75] Following the acquisition, Dingli chose to rebrand CMEC into MEC Aerial Work Platforms, although the company’s official trade name remains CMEC. [76] Dingli explained to a journalist at the time that it chose to use the MEC branding “because it is popular and has historical significance in the region.” [77] Today, CMEC maintains strong visual and branding ties to MEC. Visitors to the CMEC website encounter historical narratives that reinforce continuity with the original MEC brand and see a logo that looks nearly identical to MEC’s, as seen in figure 5 and figure 6. [78] Figure 5: MEC’s logo as of 2025 [79] Figure 6: CMEC’s logo as of 2025 [80] Furthermore, CMEC’s “Our History” page mentions neither the Dingli acquisition nor any ties to China. [81] CMEC executives simply refer to the company as “MEC.” [82] The only differences are subtle, such as using a red “®” instead of MEC’s black and white “®.” [83] To be clear, this is not trademark infringement—especially since CMEC owns an “MEC” trademark—but it appears to be using MEC’s branding to portray itself as something it no longer is. [84] MEC and CMEC could not be more different. While MEC is a longstanding U.S. defense supplier, CMEC’s new parent company, Dingli, is a defense supplier to the PLA. In 2013, Dingli obtained PLA clearances allowing it to conduct defense research and manufacture national defense equipment. [85] The year before, it had sold ¥14.62 million (approximately $2.3 million) in equipment to “a certain PLA unit”—its third-largest customer in 2012. [86] In 2016, Dingli signed a framework agreement for Military-Civilian Fusion strategic cooperation with “a unit of the PLA.” [87] The agreement gave some details into the PLA unit, saying it is “a professional underground engineering construction unit with rich experience in underground engineering excavation [and] complex structural recovery.” [88] Dingli operates “a research, testing, and training base” for the unnamed PLA unit. [89] In 2018, an article described Dingli as having “continuously supplied a wide range of national defense and military equipment to the army,” and had specifically supplied bridge-type AWPs that “fully meet the military’s requirements for modern aerial work equipment.” [90] Dingli also operates its own Iron Army training camp for employees, as seen in figure 7, emphasizing PLA-style discipline and team-building. [91] Figure 7: Dingli’s Iron Army training camp [92] A 2015 Dingli document described China’s AWP sector: “A shortage of high-end domestic production has allowed imported products to dominate areas such as military engineering.” [93] Dingli’s journey to becoming a PLA defense supplier has likely helped China shore up its defense supply chains by localizing dual-use AWP production. Beyond military goals, Dingli has also helped China achieve economic goals. Dingli stated in a 2024 document that it plans to “steadily expand its presence in North America” through CMEC, carrying out a strategy that a 2018 profile of Dingli’s founder and chairman, Xu Shugen, described as “to break the long-standing monopoly of European and American companies in the AWP sector.” [94] The following year, China’s government inducted Xu into its Ten Thousand Talents Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Leading Talents Program, which bestows support upon individuals “whose entrepreneurial projects are in line with the development direction of [China’s] strategic emerging industries and are in a leading position.” [95] Following Dingli’s acquisition of CMEC, which cost approximately $90 million, Dingli shifted much of its manufacturing to its China-based factories and expanded its U.S. operations to focus more on servicing the U.S. market and increasing research and development (R&D) investment. [96] With CMEC as a subsidiary, Dingli now has a trusted brand and existing operations base with which to access the U.S. market with prices that undercut U.S. AWP companies. The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) determined in 2025 that Dingli had sold AWPs in the United States at prices below normal value between April 2023 and March 2024 at a weighted-average dumping margin of 9.75 percent, having initially investigated Dingli’s trade practices following a petition filed by two of the largest U.S. AWP companies: JLG Industries and Terex Corporation. [97] Two factors drive Dingli’s U.S. dumping: endogenous market forces—such as lower labor costs, especially following CMEC’s outsourcing of manufacturing to China—and exogenous, market-distorting factors such as PRC subsidies. DOC preliminarily found a subsidy rate of 79.3 percent for Dingli and its subsidiaries between January and December 2022. [98] For example, in 2016, a Chinese provincial government exempted Dingli from corporate income tax of ¥19.75 million (approximately $2.77 million) in preferential policies. [99] Those subsidies align with Dingli’s ownership structure: According to WireScreen, after Xu—who owns nearly half the company—the next-largest shareholders are a cluster of Chinese state-owned financial institutions, including CITIC Securities Company Limited and the investment arms of Agricultural Bank of China, China Merchants Bank, and Bank of Communications. [100] Dingli’s founder and chairman, Xu Shugen, described the company’s goal: “To break the long-standing monopoly of European and American companies in the aerial work platform sector.” As of 2022, CMEC indirectly participated in U.S. federal procurement via H&E Equipment Services, a federal contractor later acquired by United Rentals that has supplied equipment to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOD in the past. [101] Dingli integrates its AWPs with remote monitoring and motion sensor technologies, and since Dingli increasingly manufactures CMEC’s machinery in China, it stands to reason that it might also integrate CMEC’s AWPs with these technologies. [102] If CMEC’s machines are ever used in sensitive U.S. locations, they could present a potential vector for national security concerns, especially following a 2024 congressional investigation that found potential espionage risks on Chinese-built cranes deployed at U.S. ports. [103] To be clear, there is no evidence that CMEC’s products present this type of risk, but it is the kind of cybersecurity and supply chain questions regulators should be asking of any U.S.-based company owned, in part or in full, by China’s government or companies that contract with the PLA. CMEC is a U.S.-based company that underwent a U.S. government-approved foreign acquisition, and its logo’s resemblance to MEC’s logo does not constitute trademark infringement. Yet, beneath its familiar U.S. facade and affordable AWP products is a Chinese company whose expansion into the United States aims to secure China’s long-term economic advantage in the AWP sector and ultimately profit a PLA supplier. In March 2025, the Chinese company Farasis Energy unveiled an electric vehicle (EV) battery capable of charging from 10 to 80 percent in just eight and a half minutes—a full-cycle performance that outpaces Tesla’s and other EV companies’ fastest chargers. [104] Farasis Energy grew from an American startup into one of China’s top companies in its cutthroat battery industry. But behind its technological breakthroughs lies a story of strategic government guidance, IP transfer, and obfuscation. An American, Keith Kepler, and a Canadian, Yu Wang, founded Farasis Energy in Silicon Valley in 2002. [105] Both men brought with them valuable experience in energy storage technology. Kepler worked at the Battery Development Group at Argonne National Laboratory in the late 1990s. [106] At the time, Argonne was spearheading energy storage research for the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) program collaborating with the U.S. auto industry. [107] During the same time, Wang worked for NEC Moli Energy, a Canadian research company that in 1984 commercialized the world’s first rechargeable lithium battery. [108] Between its founding in 2002 and 2009, Farasis Energy secured over $6 million in Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) awards for novel energy storage technologies, including a contract with the U.S. Navy. [109] The company also received funding for a separate project supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). [110] Then, in 2009, Farasis Energy moved to China. [111] Farasis Energy’s website today explains the move that “at the time, it was simply too cost-prohibitive to manufacture li-ion batteries in the US, and so operations were moved to Ganzhou, Jiangxi, China.” [112] Chinese language documents tell a different story. As early as 2006—during which it was receiving U.S. government funding and began work on the DARPA-funded project—Farasis Energy had signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture in Jiangxi Province, China, to manufacture products based on the company’s technology. [113] In 2009, the company established a joint venture with the Chinese state-owned company Manyuan Construction, contributing ¥175 million (approximately $25.6 million) worth of patents and proprietary technology related to lithium manganese oxide materials and lithium-ion batteries as its capital stake, while Manyuan Construction contributed ¥75 million (approximately $11 million) in cash. [114] Articles described Farasis Energy’s relocation to China as CEO Wang having “brought with him the technology and patents he had amassed over the years” and how Wang was “bringing with him cutting-edge lithium battery technology from Silicon Valley.” [115] China’s government additionally used talent plans to seal the deal. Around the time of Farasis Energy’s relocation, China’s government inducted Wang into the Thousand Talents Plan (TTP) as an “Entrepreneurial Talent,” a program that specifically targets overseas scientists and entrepreneurs who “possess independent intellectual property rights or master core technologies, [or] have overseas entrepreneurial experience.” [116] One news article describing Wang’s accolades retroactively redacted Wang’s induction into the TTP, as seen in figure 8, which aligns with China’s government’s 2018 instruction that “the phrase ‘Thousand Talents Plan’ should not appear in written circulars/notices.” [117] Figure 8: Redacted mention of Wang’s TTP induction [118] In 2011, a Jiangxi Province municipal government inducted Wang, Kepler, and Weigong Zheng—then Farasis Energy’s vice president of production of China operations—into the Jiangxi Ganpo Talent 555 Project. [119] The talent plan had been created in 2010 to “bring in 500 urgently needed high-level talents from home and abroad to innovate and start businesses in Jiangxi.” [120] As part of the talent plan, Jiangxi’s provincial government supported inductees by paying them between ¥100,000 and ¥3 million (approximately $15,000 to $460,000) and supplying benefits such as subsidized housing. [121] According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, China’s talent plans “incentivize its members to steal foreign technologies needed to advance China’s national, military, and economic goals.” [122] This is not to say that Farasis Energy did this, but that some if not many in PRC talent plans engage in these activities. Another Farasis Energy executive, Jiang Junwei, was also a TTP inductee, having worked at Farasis Energy between 2015 and 2019 following managerial positions at 3M and Johnson Controls, Inc. between 2005 and 2010. [123] Articles described Farasis Energy’s relocation to China as CEO Wang having “brought with him the technology and patents he had amassed over the years.” Between 2009 and 2025, China’s government subsidized and slowly took control of Farasis Energy. Local governments in Jiangxi Province provided land and financing for its first factories, smoothed the path for fundraising, and helped the company recruit talent. [124] National-level investors, including China Reform Holdings Corporation and China State-Owned Capital Venture Investment Fund, poured billions of renminbi in equity into Farasis Energy, framing it as a strategic asset in the country’s push for developing EVs. [125] The investors also lent support that went beyond capital, with officials personally leading site inspections, securing Farasis Energy’s headquarters facilities, and forming business partnerships with Chinese automakers on the company’s behalf. [126] In 2016, China’s former premier, Li Keqiang, inspected Farasis Energy’s facilities, as seen in figure 9, and praised the company. [127] Figure 9: China’s former premier, Li Keqiang, inspecting Farasis Energy’s facilities, 2016 [128] That trajectory culminated in 2025, when Guangzhou Industrial Investment Holding Group (GIIHG)—a municipal state-owned enterprise—became Farasis Energy’s controlling shareholder, with GIIHG and its affiliated parties holding 16.1 percent ownership. [129] GIIHG, which had attempted to increase its ownership in the company since 2022, also installed its deputy general manager, Xie Yong, as chairman. [130] Because GIIHG is owned by the Guangzhou municipal government, China’s government effectively gained state control of Farasis Energy through this transaction. In addition, the acquisition covered all international subsidiaries, meaning Farasis Energy’s original headquarters in Silicon Valley became Farasis Energy USA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Farasis Energy. [131] With GIIHG’s takeover, the setup was complete. China’s government controls Farasis Energy through a number of investments, as seen in table 1, which uses WireScreen data to show China’s beneficial direct and indirect ownership of the company, which includes GIIHG’s stake. [132] China’s government has the company positioned exactly where it wants it: anchored in China with generous industrial policy support and access to world-class manufacturing capacity, while still maintaining access to R&D, talent pipelines, IP, and funding streams in Silicon Valley. Table 1: Farasis Energy, Chinese government beneficial ownership [133] Beneficial Owners Ownership Share Department of Finance of Guangdong Province 7.9% State Council 4.0% State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of Guangdong Province Government 2.5% China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB) 2.4% China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. 2.3% State-Owned Assets Supervision and Management Commission of Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government 1.8% Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd. 0.7% Hefei Municipal State-Owned Assets Management Committee 0.3% State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) 0.1% Between 2002 and 2023, the U.S. government and USCAR funded Farasis with $13.49 million, with $9.21 million of that coming after its relocation to China in 2009. Even following its relocation to China, Farasis Energy USA has had no problems accessing U.S. government funding. Between 2009 and 2013, Farasis won a total of $2.03 million in SBIR grants, including awards from both the U.S. Navy and Air Force. [134] Between 2017 and 2023, the United States Advanced Battery Consortium LLC (USABC) awarded Farasis Energy USA with four cost share contracts totaling $14.36 million, of which DOE funded half of at least one of the contracts. [135] USABC is a subsidiary of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USCAR), which is funded by DOE as well as Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis. [136] In total, between 2002 and 2023, USCAR and the U.S. government funded Farasis with $13.49 million, with $9.21 million of that coming after its relocation to China in 2009, as seen in figure 10. [137] A Chinese article from 2021 about Farasis Energy described its funding from USCAR as a “stepping stone” to “open up the North American market.” [138] Figure 10: U.S. government and USCAR funding awarded to Farasis Energy, 2002–2023 [139] A 2024 report from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace concludes that the United States’ only chance to compete with China in the future battery market is to quickly commercialize emerging battery technologies such as lithium iron phosphate and solid state. The report laments the fact that “of the $24 billion in U.S. federal grants and loan guarantees through the Department of Energy over the last two years … more than 90 percent of the funding has supported lithium-ion batteries.” [140] Farasis Energy USA’s most recent U.S. government subsidization, which funded the company with $2.6 million between 2023 and 2025, was “to develop beyond lithium-ion battery technologies,” making it part of the 10 percent exception to focus on next-generation batteries. [141] This direction was the right one: R&D investments in advanced batteries can help the United States compete with China in the global battery market, and, as the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has noted, enable clean energy technologies to challenge fossil fuels on price and performance. [142] Yet, in this case, that taxpayer-funded innovation flowed to a Chinese state-owned company. Unlike CAT or CMEC, Farasis Energy does not fully obscure its ties to China; its U.S. subsidiary openly acknowledges its relocation to China. [143] Yet, the company obscures the full story of its Chinese-government-directed ownership, IP transfer, and talent integration. While Farasis Energy USA contributes to the U.S. economy through employment and innovation, China’s economy ultimately gains much more, since Farasis Energy USA’s U.S.-government-subsidized R&D helped its parent company improve its R&D. By relocating its supply chains and manufacturing to China and benefiting from PRC subsidies, Farasis Energy is well-positioned to compete for global market share in batteries, with profits primarily benefitting Chinese shareholders, including state-owned entities. Speaking about Farasis Energy’s state-sponsored ownership, Wang said, “[W]e hold distinct advantages over foreign competitors.” [144] As this report’s case studies illustrate, Chinese companies use a range of tactics to obscure the PRC’s government influence in the U.S. economy. Understanding these patterns is key to accurately assessing the risks and designing effective policy responses. Not all branding choices, foreign investment, or U.S.-based Chinese operations present risks to national security or to competitiveness in key industries, including dual-use industries. The concern behind this report’s three case studies is not merely about branding. Companies such as Farasis Energy openly acknowledge their Chinese ownership, and CMEC’s logo resemblance to MEC’s is legal. Branding alone does not constitute a national security issue. The core problem identified in this report is obfuscation of ownership, governance, and strategic intent—and the U.S. government’s failure to detect and address that obfuscation. Most foreign investment in the U.S. economy does not pose a problem. Allied company investment, especially new greenfield investment, can add valuable production and capabilities to the U.S. economy. In contrast, China’s investments into the U.S. economy highlighted in this report are different. They represent successful execution of China’s coordinated strategy to gain economic and technological leverage over the United States by hollowing out U.S. competitors. [145] The distinction is between benign foreign investment and state-supported efforts to undercut critical industries. The United States should not close itself off to all Chinese investment, especially greenfield investment. The issue is not whether Chinese companies operate in the U.S. market, but where and how they do so. Some degree of branding obfuscation—such as the Chinese retailer MINISO, which is expanding in the United States and has previously styled itself as Japanese—poses little risk, especially if the company operates in noncritical consumer sectors. [146] These industries have minimal bearing on U.S. national power, and market forces can readily replace lost supply. [147] The calculus changes when Chinese investment targets defense, dual-use, or enabling industries. [148] In these sectors, ownership transparency matters because the technologies and supply chains involved directly or indirectly support key U.S. industrial and defense capabilities. [149] CAT, CMEC, and Farasis Energy all operate in dual-use industries. Their products are not intrinsically defense-specific, but could—and in CMEC’s and possibly CAT’s cases, do—support defense operations. At the same time, some Chinese participation in dual-use industries, such as import-export logistics, critical minerals, or advanced components—as well as many enabling industries—remains integral to U.S. supply chains today. That reality underscores the need for the U.S. government to de-risk inbound greenfield investment from China, rather than outright decouple. CAT is just one of numerous AVIC-controlled companies operating in the United States. [150] For example, AVIC also acquired the U.S. company Henniges Automotive in 2015. [151] Some of the same risks outlined in the CAT case study likely also apply to Henniges Automotive. While this report’s case studies represent individual examples of China’s obfuscation of ownership and intent, they also represent just the tip of the iceberg. Additionally, while CAT, CMEC, and Farasis Energy all obscure their ties to China in different ways, they share a common pattern: each underwent acquisitions or investment from entities linked to China’s government. This illustrates one form of obfuscation—masking ownership through corporate acquisitions or partial stakes—but there are many other mechanisms. These three cases, additionally, represent an earlier wave of Chinese overseas investment activity. China’s current tactics to gain footholds in the U.S. economy have likely evolved to become more subtle than headline-grabbing acquisitions and instead feature quieter financial maneuvers. At this point, CAT, CMEC, and Farasis Energy are historical, “right of boom”—that is, post-incident—examples that nonetheless provide useful evidence of PRC obfuscation. The current generation of obfuscation toward U.S. companies still “left of boom” will still feature obscured Chinese influence not only through rebranding or “doing business as” names that hide the ultimate parent company, but also through less-visible corporate structures such as debt holdings, layered venture funding, or private companies with opaque capitalization. For a more recent example, the autonomous trucking company TuSimple billed itself as a dual-headquartered startup in Silicon Valley and China and signed a national-security agreement with the U.S. government but ultimately siphoned money and trade secrets to China. [152] Policy solutions should therefore not just focus on tactics seen in “right of boom” cases but also account for emerging obfuscation that evolves and adapts to regulatory and market conditions. While CMEC is subject to duties for subsidization and dumping, and CAT faces restrictions due to its AVIC ownership, all three case studies show that the U.S. government has historically acted too late or not at all. CFIUS allowed CAT and CMEC’s acquisitions, and CAT and Farasis Energy received millions of dollars in U.S. subsidies long after their ties to China’s government had been made clear. In other examples, the U.S. government has instituted checks on Chinese investments in the U.S. economy, but they are still flawed. For example, Zheng Weigong—one of three Farasis Energy employees that China’s government inducted into the Jiangxi Ganpo Talent 555 Project talent plan—later joined a different Chinese battery company, EVE Energy. [153] WireScreen identifies EVE Energy as a state security contractor with defense contractor involvement. [154] The U.S. government listed EVE Energy in the 2024 NDAA as one of six Chinese battery companies that DOD cannot contract with after October 2027. [155] Why the six companies were given until that late date is not clear. A proposed bill in the current sessions of the House and the Senate—Decoupling from Foreign Adversarial Battery Dependence Act—would similarly prohibit DHS from contracting with EVE Energy and the other five Chinese battery companies named in the 2024 NDAA. [156] However, that bill has yet to pass in the Senate, where it also failed to pass the originally introduced bill in the 118th Congress. [157] And this whack-a-mole approach, while better than nothing, is fundamentally too limited. Moreover, this example illustrates two issues with current legislation seeking to protect the U.S. economy from Chinese economic obfuscation: 1. Failure to defend a large attack surface. Neither the NDAA’s future cutoff of EVE Energy’s ability to become part of the U.S. defense industrial base nor the proposed bill focused on protecting DHS’s supply chain are the right solution. DOD and DHS are just two avenues through which a company such as EVE Energy can access the expansive amount of procurement the U.S. government offers. For example, in 2022, EVE Energy was able to access U.S. government funding at the subnational level in Ohio, when the state’s private economic development corporation, JobsOhio, awarded a $1 million grant to EVE Energy North America to construct a lithium-ion battery research facility. [158] JobsOhio had faced scrutiny in the past for awarding funding to companies with concerning ties to China, but the deal went through anyway. [159] EVE Energy expects its new research facility to create a mere 12 new jobs. [160] Twelve new jobs are not worth $1 million, nor does that number of new jobs offset R&D gains from the $1 million that EVE Energy will use to compete with U.S. battery companies in the future and feed into its defense work in China. On defending U.S. procurement power, a more whole-of-government approach is needed. And as the CAT case study shows, procurement is just one vector that can benefit Chinese companies operating obfuscated in the U.S. economy. 2. Struggles to identify risk. The U.S. government likely added EVE Energy and the other five Chinese battery companies to the NDAA due to their ties to China’s military. [161] Despite no identified open-source military ties for Farasis Energy, the company’s control by China’s government and long track record of using its operations in the U.S. economy to economically benefit China beg the question why Farasis Energy was not also on the NDAA’s list. The U.S. government is still deciding case by case which companies pose risk and which do not, rather than applying a consistent framework. This report’s case studies suggest the need for the U.S. government to more comprehensively approach transparency, ownership disclosure, and risk management of Chinese investment in the U.S. economy, especially within defense, dual-use, and enabling industries. The following recommendations explain how the U.S. government can strengthen its systems to reduce vulnerabilities to Chinese techno-industrial predation. 1. Strengthen CFIUS screening and oversight. As of 2020, CFIUS is implementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) in its screens. [162] FIRRMA states that CFIUS should also factor into its reviews “whether a covered transaction involves a country of special concern that has a demonstrated or declared strategic goal of acquiring a type of critical technology or critical infrastructure that would affect United States leadership in areas related to national security.” [163] Dingli’s acquisition of CMEC took place following this rule change. It is unclear if CFIUS cleared the transaction with mitigation measures imposed, but clearly chose not to block the transaction. One could argue that China acquiring a single U.S. AWP company may not, on its own, materially affect U.S. leadership in national security, but Dingli’s PLA connections put CFIUS’s decision into question. Congress should expand FIRRMA to widen the definition of what would affect U.S. leadership. CFIUS’s mandate should encompass not only threats to U.S. leadership “in areas related to national security” but also industries critical to economic and strategic competitiveness, such as civilian aerospace engines, AWPs, and advanced batteries. [164] CFIUS should also create a comprehensive registry of all Chinese-origin companies operating in the United States, including subsidiaries, joint ventures, firms with Chinese financing, and entities with partial Chinese government ownership. To ensure that the list is accurate and up to date, CFIUS should leverage private sector open source intelligence providers to both identify Chinese-controlled entities that may otherwise evade detection and ensure that the registry remains accurate and up to date. 2. Expand ownership disclosure. Congress should expand the Corporate Transparency Act to require Chinese-origin companies operating in U.S. power industries—industries that enable a strong military or give the United States leverage over other nations, especially China—to report beneficial ownership and operational control, including minority stakes, joint ventures, offshore subsidiaries, and IP transfer rights. [165] Using CFIUS’s registry, the Securities and Exchange Commission should collect detailed information on ownership and decision-making structures, while DOC should verify compliance and monitor access to dual-use technology and strategic assets. Companies that fail to provide full transparency should be barred from doing business in America, and CFIUS and DOC should have authority to enforce restrictions or divestment where necessary to protect U.S. national security. 3. Proactively use NDAA and CFIUS authority. Congress should direct NDAA authorities that the NDAA for FY26 mandate that agencies expand Section 1260H and related authorities to ensure that Chinese-origin companies in defense, dual-use, and enabling industries cannot indirectly advance military capabilities. [166] This should include explicit prohibitions on contracting, technology sharing, and participation in federally funded programs. The NDAA should also direct agencies to require ongoing reporting for Chinese companies, covering IP transfers, supplier relationships, and workforce development activities. 4. Block subsidies to PRC-financed companies. Federal agencies, led by the Office of Management and Budget, should bar companies with PRC financing from receiving U.S. government funding, tax incentives, or other financial support. The same should apply to companies with involvement in China’s military or dual-use programs. These checks should span both national and subnational levels, with CFIUS coordinating with state-level economic development offices. U.S. state policy has sped ahead on foreign adversary defensive regulation, but in many cases, these laws are flawed and could be better harmonized to national-level security priorities. [167] Federal agencies such as DOE, DOD, National Science Foundation, and Department of Transportation, as well as federal agency-linked consortiums such as USCAR, should also implement pre-award due diligence to screen for Chinese ownership, operational control, or dual-use access before awarding grants or cooperative agreements. This would ensure that U.S. taxpayer funds support domestic innovation rather than foreign industrial strategy. In addition, USDT, through CFIUS, working with funding agencies, should require companies that receive U.S. federal funding to obtain explicit U.S. government approval before relocating operations or substantial portions of their workforce or IP to China. This requirement would ideally be designed to not prevent legitimate global business activity but rather ensure that taxpayer-funded investments are not diverted to foreign jurisdictions in ways that could undermine U.S. strategic industrial capabilities. 5. Clarify brand obscuration practices. Companies such as CMEC maintain U.S. branding to obscure foreign ownership, misleading stakeholders and regulators. FTC, with congressional authority as needed, should issue guidance on truth-in-branding and ownership disclosure by requiring companies in defense, dual-use, or enabling industries to clearly disclose foreign state ownership or control in marketing, websites, and communications. In addition, for Chinese companies operating in defense, dual-use, or enabling industries, Congress should consider legislation or FTC rulemaking to mandate disclosure of foreign state ownership or control in a standardized and visible manner. [168] This requirement would not apply to benign consumer sectors, where branding obfuscation poses minimal national security or economic risk, but would prevent companies in critical sectors from misleading U.S. consumers, investors, or regulators about their foreign affiliations. 6. Centralize interagency due diligence. USDT, along with DOC, DOD, and other relevant agencies, and with oversight from the House and Senate intelligence committees, should establish a single, interagency due-diligence database that integrates CFIUS, DOC, and federal grant-funding data to screen all potential recipients of federal awards, contracts, and research grants. As the Select Committee on the CCP’s Fox in the Henhouse 2025 report and a recent article, “Why Is the U.S. Defense Department Funding China’s Military Research?” underscore, a lack of data interoperability has enabled Chinese defense-linked institutions to receive U.S. funding through loopholes in agency coordination. [169] A unified system bringing together in-house capabilities and outsourced procured capabilities would automatically flag any entity on federal restriction lists (e.g., the Entity List, Section 1260H list, or the NS-CMIC list) before awards are approved. Another area of improved intelligence sharing would be for CFIUS to integrate trade intelligence into its screens. DOC’s trade enforcement arm routinely collects detailed information on foreign corporate ownership, subsidy networks, and state involvement, producing rich data that overlaps with the national security risks CFIUS evaluates. In the CMEC case, DOC may have identified Dingli as a PLA supplier during its subsidization investigation, even though DOC’s investigations are not designed for national security screening. While DOC is part of CFIUS, it is unclear whether DOC would have shared this intelligence with CFIUS when the committee was conducting its own screen of Dingli. [170] There are no clear formal mechanisms for synthesizing such information, and the Government Accountability Office has documented interagency coordination gaps across U.S. efforts to mitigate national security risks from foreign investment in the U.S. economy. [171] CFIUS should establish a formal analytic mechanism—led by USDT in coordination with DOC’s International Trade Administration and Bureau of Industry and Security—to integrate dumping, subsidy, and export-control data into investment reviews. This report’s case studies demonstrate a consistent pattern: Chinese companies use a variety of legal and financial structures, branding strategies, and investment pathways to obscure government influence and strategic intent in the U.S. economy. When these practices occur in defense, dual-use, or enabling industries, they can directly affect U.S. industrial, technological, and national security competitiveness. Current U.S. oversight mechanisms are narrow and reactive, allowing state-linked Chinese entities to access market trust and sensitive technologies. Implementation of the recommendations outlined in this report will help ensure the United States maintains an open economy while protecting critical sectors from strategic exploitation.

"EU Digital Services Act Lacks Transparency to Assess Its Impact on Free Speech Globally, New ITIF Report Finds",2025-10-20,Ash Johnson,"WASHINGTON—As debate intensifies in Washington over whether the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) threatens free speech beyond Europe, a new analysis from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) finds that the law’s reporting system and publicly available records don’t provide sufficient transparency to assess its true impact on users’ free speech globally as platforms adopt Europe’s regulatory standards in other jurisdictions to simplify their compliance obligations. “The DSA is intended to increase transparency and accountability in content moderation, but its reporting requirements are too vague to allow researchers, regulators, or users to fully analyze the law’s effects,” said Ash Johnson , ITIF senior policy manager and co-author of the report. “Without clearer data, there is no way to assess whether EU rules are inadvertently restricting lawful speech for American users or others around the world.” The DSA requires large online platforms to report content moderation decisions in a public Transparency Database. ITIF examined millions of moderation actions submitted within a single 24-hour period in July 2024 and found that nearly 90 percent relied on overly broad categories such as “scope of platform service,” while essential details—like whether EU-mandated decisions were applied outside Europe—were often missing. These gaps make it impossible to evaluate the law’s effects on users in the United States or globally. To provide meaningful transparency and better assess potential global effects, ITIF recommends: Removing the vague “scope of platform service” category and expanding reporting to reflect specific EU laws or platform policies. Separating “illegal or harmful speech” into distinct categories to clarify free speech implications. Requiring platforms to indicate whether content removal was based on EU law or their own terms of service. Requiring platforms to disclose whether EU moderation decisions were applied outside the EU. “Fixing these transparency gaps would allow researchers, policymakers, and users to understand the DSA’s real-world effects,” said Johnson. “That would help ensure that European regulatory standards don’t restrict lawful speech in the United States or worldwide.” Read the report.

Beyond Copycat Regulation: A Playbook for Korea’s Digital Partnerships,2025-10-24,Sejin Kim,"A recent ITIF webinar on the impact of foreign regulations on U.S. tech leadership and security underscored a simple yet significant point: The time for EU-style digital regulation—if there ever was one—is over. For partners like South Korea, which stands at a crossroads in shaping and regulating its digital markets, the stakes are especially high. The only winner from Seoul emulating Europe’s precautionary, anti-innovation model is China. The losers are democratic allies. Michael Brown, former director of the Defense Innovation Unit at the U.S. Department of Defense, highlighted how tightly intertwined technology, military capability, and economic prosperity are in today’s U.S.–China techno-economic competition. Leadership in AI, high-performance computing, and networking is no longer purely commercial—these sectors now constitute the backbone of national security. Brown warned that data localization weakens AI performance by fragmenting training sets, while short-term financial pressures in capital markets erode long-term R&D and manufacturing capacity. Sustained competitiveness, he argued, requires tax and disclosure policies that incentivize patient investment. Stephen Ezell, vice president of global innovation policy at ITIF, pointed out that frontier innovation depends on scale, global markets, and intellectual property. Yet foreign fines and discriminatory rules drain the revenues needed to reinvest in the next wave of technologies. For example, he explained that the EU’s Digital Markets Act—designed primarily to target American firms—undermines core WTO principles of reciprocity and nondiscrimination. Similar patterns are now visible in Korea, where regulators have taken steps that risk targeting U.S. companies. Ezell stressed that what matters more than “digital sovereignty” is building digital capability and spreading advanced technologies to SMEs. He called for an allied leadership strategy spanning export controls, FDI screening, standards, R&D, and workforce development, noting the NATO Innovation Fund as a constructive model. Christina Alfonso, president of the Council on Global Competition and Innovation, warned that heavy-handed rules by allies can inadvertently strengthen China by raising costs and slowing innovation. With data centers, submarine cables, and satellites already requiring massive capital, additional regulatory burdens risk undermining long-term infrastructure investment. Alfonso argued that forums such as the U.S.–EU Trade and Technology Council should evolve into true decision-making bodies for AI and quantum technologies. She also urged mobilizing private capital, from asset managers and pension funds to family offices, into “national security investments” that strengthen critical technologies. For Korea, the lesson is clear: Emulating Europe’s regulatory instincts will not deliver digital competitiveness; it will only weaken the allies’ collective position against China’s techno-economic ambitions and trade threats. Following the EU’s defensive model risks isolation and lost competitiveness, while a partnership-based approach positions Korea to help shape global standards. The smart path for all democratic allies is to co-invest, co-develop, and co-regulate emerging technologies. A strategy grounded in coordination—not fragmented sovereignty or EU-style constraint—offers Korea its strongest route to innovation, security, and sustainable growth.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/24/beyond-copycat-regulation-playbook-for-korea-digital-partnerships/

Europe’s Cyber Blueprint is a Model for Regional Cybersecurity Cooperation,2025-10-21,David Kertai,"The European Union, in June 2025, adopted the Cyber Crisis Management Blueprint , a policy framework outlining how the EU and its member states will prepare for and jointly manage large-scale cyber incidents. The framework aims to harmonize how the union detects and responds to cyber incidents . This move comes amid growing threats from both non-state and state-backed actors , such as the ransomware attack against EU airports last month. The Blueprint marks a much-needed step toward coordinated European cybersecurity efforts that offer a unified response framework , build on existing policies , and embed rapid-response mechanisms that collectively strengthen Europe’s cyber resilience and serve as a model for other regions. The EU’s Blueprint aims to close gaps in interoperability among member states’ cybersecurity systems, especially during crises. It strengthens technical and operational readiness by leveraging the European Cyber Crisis Liaison Organization Network , which links national authorities and technical teams to maintain communication and rapidly share information, such as synchronized public warnings and mitigation measures during cross-border cyber attacks. These capabilities build on the EU’s 2017 Cyber Shield Strategy , which boosted collective resilience and cyber defense. The framework also aligns with existing policies, such as the Network and Information System 2 Directive (NIS2), which sets cybersecurity risk management and reporting rules for critical sectors; the Cyber Solidarity Act , which creates an EU-wide detection and response infrastructure; the Integrated Political Crisis Response mechanism, which coordinates EU-level decision-making during large-scale crises; and the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox , which enables the EU to impose sanctions and take joint diplomatic action against cyber threat actors. The Blueprint also provides common procedures and shared terminology for joint responses. It draws on prior initiatives like the Cybersecurity Emergency Mechanism , which funds rapid assistance and enables mutual support during major cyber incidents, and the Cybersecurity Reserve , a group of vetted private sector cybersecurity providers on call to deliver specialized expertise during emergencies, helping states respond to and recover from attacks. Together, these measures boost legal coherence and operational readiness, giving the EU a foundation to adapt as threats evolve. By establishing a common playbook for cross-border crisis coordination, the Blueprint enhances the EU’s collective ability to withstand cyber incidents, particularly by enabling seamless coordination during large-scale attacks. Its rolling annex , a constantly updated document by the EU’s Agency for Cybersecurity, incorporates lessons learned and emerging practices, ensuring the framework remains responsive to the evolving threat landscape. By clearly defining responsibilities, it empowers member states to respond quickly and cohesively , containing crises, protecting critical infrastructure, and essential services. Recent Russian and Chinese state-backed cyber attacks have repeatedly targeted European networks and critical infrastructure , exposing EU states’ vulnerabilities against sophisticated adversaries. The European Commission has also highlighted recent attacks in sectors such as public administration , healthcare , and telecom systems . In response, the Blueprint defines clear steps in how to respond—if an actor disables a member state’s aviation systems, EU agencies and other countries follow predefined steps to assess the situation and provide assistance, from sharing threat information to deploying technical experts. While the Blueprint is tailored to Europe’s integrated governance, its principles offer guidance for other regional institutions like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the African Union (AU). ASEAN’s Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy (2021–2025) promotes cyber-readiness, regional coordination, and capacity-building, including the planned ASEAN Regional Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) led by Singapore, but progress is constrained by uneven cyber maturity and the CERT network’s early stage of development. The AU, for its part, has made cybersecurity a cross-cutting priority in its Digital Transformation Strategy and advanced legal frameworks such as the Malabo Convention , yet the convention only recently entered into force in 2023 and awaits wider ratification. The EU model provides practical lessons, such as establishing common crisis response playbooks to ensure member states can work together, funding shared rapid-response resources like a cybersecurity reserve, and embedding private-sector expertise into regional frameworks. Taken together, these measures represent a decisive step toward building a more resilient and coordinated digital Europe. By addressing modern cyber threats, fostering operational unity, and aligning with policies like NIS2, the Blueprint strengthens Europe’s cyber resilience, models effective crisis management, and balances structure with flexibility, setting an example for other regional institutions.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/21/europes-cyber-shield-is-a-model-for-regional-cybersecurity-cooperation/
Fact of the Week: Data Center Capacity Will Need to Increase by 130 Percent by 2030 to Meet the Demand for AI,2025-10-27,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: Abhineet Kaul, et al ., “AI Beyond Data Centers: On-Device, On-Demand, Everywhere,” (Access Partnership, October 13, 2025). Commentary: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to be a generational productivity and growth catalyst, with experts estimating that the technology will lead to a 7 percent increase in worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) growth and a 1.5 percent or more increase in productivity over the next decade. However, technology also requires significant energy to perform the inferences that enable it to produce text, images, and videos. At the current pace of AI growth, compute demand is projected to increase by a factor of 125 by 2030, requiring more and larger data centers that consume large amounts of energy. In fact, data center capacity will need to grow by 130 percent by 2030 to meet this demand, the equivalent of building 1,000 hyperscale data centers. What’s more, the resources needed to build and power these data centers will be costly, requiring an additional $2.8 trillion in infrastructure investment on top of what major tech firms have already committed (estimated at $3 to $8 trillion). On-device AI—a lightweight model that runs on a user device rather than relying on a data center—is a solution to this data center bottleneck. These smaller AI models are estimated to reduce AI's total power consumption by about 90 percent.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/27/data-center-capacity-will-need-increase-130-percent-by-2030-meet-demand-for-ai/
"I Haven’t Worked in Industry, But I’m Right About America’s Robot Problem",2025-10-24,Robert D. Atkinson,"The United States lags far behind China in industrial robot adoption. This is particularly bizarre given that robot adoption should correlate with labor costs: Higher labor costs make the payback from installing robots much faster. And because Chinese labor costs are significantly lower than those in the United States, we should be the ones in the lead—not China. So, what’s going on? As ITIF has written , the CCP has made robot adoption a national priority; one might say, an obsession. Not only do Chinese government officials give “administrative guidance” to companies (essentially, “you will install robots!”), but they also provide massive subsidies for doing so. Installing robots in China is a key part of the country’s “ great rejuvenation .” The United States is the yin to China’s yang. With capital-lite corporate strategies dominant because of Wall Street pressures for high return on net assets (RONA) and high return on net invested capital, U.S. companies invest relatively little in robotics. (They maintain high RONA by keeping assets low.) And companies that do install robots have to engage in all sorts of contortions to show that they would never, ever use robots to lay off workers. Finally, while the United States once had an investment tax credit for installing new machines, Congress—under the guidance of neoclassical economists who said this was inefficient—eliminated it in 1986. We can see the results in the latest NSF innovation survey, which now asks questions about adoption of new technologies. The 2023 survey not only shows that firms don’t adopt robots, but that they don’t even think they should. A whopping 55 percent of manufacturing companies not only don’t have robots but also think “this technology is not applicable to my business.” Another 21 percent did not know, and 14 percent said robots were applicable, but they didn’t use them. Just 8.3 percent had adopted robots. Now, I am not a business executive (unless you want to call the think tank world an industry), but I have to say I get irritated when I hear executives pontificate about tech-industrial policy even though they’ve never studied it. Still, the fact that 76 percent of manufacturers either don’t want robots or don’t know if they’re relevant seems shockingly high, especially as robotics technology has vastly improved and fallen in price over the past decade. Do these companies still use fax machines? This is even more problematic because, just as there are externalities from company investments in R&D (companies don’t capture all the benefits, which is why we have an R&D tax credit), there are also societal externalities from investment in new machinery. In fact, research shows that companies capture only about half of the total societal return from their investment in new capital equipment. That means that, absent some kind of policy intervention, the rate of capital investment, including in robots, will be suboptimal. It’s time to face reality. The U.S. economy is capital-lite, and it is designed to be that way. China is capital-heavy, and it is designed to be that way. It doesn’t take a weatherman to know which way that wind blows: Chinese labor productivity, especially in manufacturing, will continue to grow, giving Chinese firms a double advantage in global markets—relatively low labor costs and strong productivity. U.S. manufacturing labor productivity is likely to stagnate or even continue to decline, as it has for the last 13 years . If this is the case, the only way to keep U.S. manufacturing from declining even more is either to impose tariffs (or other taxes such as a border-adjustable VAT or import bans on Chinese goods) or to accept a significant decline in the dollar (something that needs to happen anyway). Why does almost no one in Washington seem to even notice these trends—much less care about them? This should be on the front page of The Wall Street Journal , Forbes , and even The New York Times . The answer lies in the insular “Panglossian” nature of U.S. economic thinking. As Dr. Pangloss stated, “everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds,” despite evidence to the contrary. Everything is for the best because, by definition, market forces always produce the best (leaving aside business-cycle dips). If we could change just one thing in Washington when it comes to economic thinking, it would be this: We no longer live in Dr. Pangloss’s world. We live in a world of massively unfair competition with China that is based on anything but market forces. And because of Wall Street, market forces now focus not on the maximization of long-term national value but on short-term shareholder returns. That is producing bad results for the nation. Not enough space here to address the issue in full, but here’s one idea: President Trump should issue an annual award at the White House to firms that have done the best job of installing robots, and use his bully pulpit to shame other executives who have gone capital-lite and failed to invest in automation.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/24/i-havent-worked-in-industry-but-im-right-about-americas-robot-problem/
Comments to EU Regarding the Draft Revised Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation and Technology Transfer Guidelines Introduction Clarification of TTBER Market Share Thresholds for Technology Markets New Guidance on Data Licensing Modification of the GuiDance on Technology Pools New Guidance on licensing negotiation groups (LNGs) Conclusion Endnotes,2025-10-24,Joseph V. Coniglio,"Contents Introduction . 1 Clarification of TTBER Market Share Thresholds for Technology Markets 2 New Guidance on Data Licensing . 2 Modification of the GuiDance on Technology Pools 3 New Guidance on licensing negotiation groups (LNGs) 4 Conclusion . 5 Endnotes 5 On September 11, 2025, the European Commission (Commission) launched a public consultation on published drafts of the revised Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (TTBER) and Technology Transfer Guidelines (Draft Revised Guidelines). [1] The TTBER, which exempts certain technology transfer agreements from antitrust scrutiny under Article 101(1), as well as the Draft Revised Guidelines, which provide important guidance on how the TTBER will be applied, are key parts of the Commission’s approach to the critical area involving the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property (IP) rights. [2] The consultation is part of a multi-year review that included both an evaluation phase and ongoing impact assessment phase where the Commission gathered evidence and solicited stakeholder feedback on its TTBER regime. [3] As the Commission has explained, the revision “aims to adapt the rules to reflect recent market developments and case law by the Court of Justice of the European Union, as well as to provide legal certainty for companies wishing to enter into technology transfer agreements.” [4] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the world’s top-ranked science and technology policy think tank, greatly appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Commission’s public consultation. In general, ITIF believes that the proposed revisions involving TTBER market share thresholds, data licensing, and technology pools may prove beneficial toward enhancing innovation and competition in technology licensing. However, ITIF is concerned that the Draft Revised Guidelines’ new safe harbour for licensing negotiation groups (LNGs) would, unless additional conditions are included, disrupt the delicate balance between IP holders and implementers, as well as provide an avenue for protectionist enforcement within EU competition policy. Article 3 of the TTBER makes clear that the block exemption will only apply if certain market share thresholds are met. [5] However, as the Commission has explained, “many stakeholders reported practical difficulties in applying the TTBER’s market share thresholds for technology markets.” [6] In response, the Commission has proposed two main changes for the TTBER market share thresholds: first, in recital 13, confirming that technologies with no current sales have zero market shares; and second, that when market shares rise above the thresholds over the life of the agreement, the grace period for which the block exemption still applies will be extended from two to three years. [7] These changes are likely to both improve administrability and reduce error costs associated with enforcing the TTBER. Specifically, by confirming that technologies with no current sales have zero market shares, the Commission is not just formalizing guidance from an earlier communication, but interpreting the TTBER in a way that is consistent with the dynamic and often fraught nature of the innovation process—even very valuable IP with a high share in a technology market may not, for a variety of reasons, ultimately be deployed in a downstream innovation. [8] Similarly, even when IP is implemented in a product that gains a high market share, the dynamic nature of competition in high-tech markets can make even a short-term dominant position fleeting. As such, the shift to a three-year grace period better ensures that scrutiny under Article 101(1) applies to technologies that have resulted in the creation of a significant and durable market position. The current TTBER and Technology Transfer Guidelines provide that an exemption from Article 101(1) applies to agreements that involve the transfer of technology rights and certain associated know-how, encompassing patents, utility models, design rights, and other forms of IP. But, as the Commission notes, “data licensing agreements are increasingly common, and some stakeholders called on the Commission to provide guidance in this area, as the current TTBER and Guidelines do not include specific guidance.” [9] In response, the Commission’s proposed revisions include clarifying that the TTBER can apply to data licensing when the data qualifies as an existing technology right defined in the TTBER—including data licensing involving databases protected by sui generis rights or copyright—that non-exempted data licensing will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and that Chapter 6 of the Guidelines on Horizontal Agreements will apply in cases where data licensing involves competitors exchanging commercially sensitive information. [10] In general, these changes are a positive step because the Commission is rightfully bringing data that qualifies as one of the existing technology rights as defined in the TTBER under the same framework that already applies to patents, designs, and other IP. Indeed, this is particularly important given that emerging high-value sectors like AI and biotechnology critically depend not just on the exchange of traditional IP, but on data-driven technology transfers. And, while it is true that data licensing is generally procompetitive, to avoid false negatives and potential uncertainty the block exemption should not be expanded to include other forms of data licensing, particularly if the latter is evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it will result in anticompetitive effects, which helps to mitigate the risk of error costs in the form of false positives. Although the proposed revisions clarify how the TTBER applies to data and database licensing, their impact may depend on how this framework interacts with other EU laws that define data protection and access rights. For instance, Recital 112 of the Data Act excludes machine-generated data from sui generis database protection, in part because the Commission argues that competition is stronger when users can freely access and share data generated by connected devices with third parties. [11] But to the extent that data-licensing agreements based on this type of dataset categorically fall outside the protections of the TTBER, the Commission may consider either revisiting the Data Act so that certain types of machine-generated datasets can qualify for sui generis protection and thus fall within the TTBER’s safe harbour, or alternatively consider introducing a limited carve-out within the TTBER itself to exempt certain types of legitimate, procompetitive licensing of machine-generated data. ITIF agrees with the Commission that “the guidance on the assessment of pools under Article 101 of the Treaty has been generally effective in providing legal certainty for undertakings,” in particular with respect to the safe harbour that puts qualifying technology pools outside the scope of Article 101(1) scrutiny. [12] In addition, ITIF does not raise concerns with the new transparency, essentiality, and dipping requirements for this safe harbour as a way to address the Commission’s lingering concerns in these areas, but would note that the Commission could consider that implementers too can in some circumstances be in a position to take steps to lessen double dipping. Moreover, ITIF supports the Draft Revised Guidelines’ clarification that technologies licensed out by the pool must be licensed on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms to the extent that the technology pool includes standards encumbered technologies—in particular, standard essential patents (SEPs)—to alleviate the risk of hold-up. [13] The most significant change contemplated by the Draft Revised Guidelines involves LNGs, defined as “arrangements whereby potential licensees (technology implementers) agree to negotiate the terms of technology transfer agreements jointly.” [14] While recognizing the concerns that LNGs can facilitate the possibility of anticompetitive collusion, and in particular hold-out, the Draft Revised Guidelines create a safe harbour for LNGs subject to a number of conditions that include open participation, transparency requirements, limited scope, restrictions on the ability to exchange information, non-exclusivity (as qualified below), and a cap that licensing fees must not exceed 10% of the sale price of the products incorporating the licensed technology. [15] Although ITIF recognizes the administrability benefits that such a safe harbour might bring, it is concerned that increased error costs in the form of false negatives will outweigh any of those gains. To be sure, LNGs that have an efficiency justification—and, as such, are not buyer cartels—are often procompetitive and may be properly subject to some type of safe harbour that is designed to exclude LNGs that are able to anticompetitively exercise buy or sell side market power. [16] However, the Draft Revised Guidelines do not appear to include conditions that sufficiently mitigate this risk, either in the form of a commitment that the LNGs will obtain a license of FRAND terms—as in the technology pool safe harbour—or through LNG specific market share thresholds given that, unlike in the technology pool case where the TTBER is designed to protect the pooling of complements, LNGs inherently involve concerted action between competing buyers. Moreover, while the Draft Revised Guidelines are clear that, to qualify for the safe harbour, the LNG must not have the power to “limit the freedom of LNG members to negotiate and conclude agreements bilaterally with technology holders,” an exception exists whereby “bilateral negotiations may be restricted for a short (6-month) period to incentivize joint negotiations through the LNG.” [17] Yet, it is unclear why such an exception is reasonably necessary to achieve the procompetitive benefits that are to be gained by negotiating through the LNG: not only does the 6-month window appear arbitrary, but if the LNG is truly efficiency enhancing, that should itself provide sufficient incentives for its members to eschew separate bilateral negotiations. In addition to these economic harms, ITIF is also concerned that the LNG safe harbour may encourage TTBER enforcement that serves protectionist purposes at the expense of competition and innovation. Indeed, these concerns are exacerbated by the Commission’s recent guidance letter explaining that an automotive LNG comprised by founding members BMW, Mercedes, and Volkswagen—the three largest German car companies—and designed for the purpose of negotiating SEP licenses did not raise concerns under Article 101. [18] Importantly, the rationale given for this decision was not that the members lacked a low combined market share—they did not—but rather that the licensing rates were a very small percentage of the overall end product (cars) and information sharing was said to be appropriately limited. [19] This reasoning confuses a necessary condition with a sufficient one when it comes to assessing the competitive harm an LNG may pose: that an LNG may not result in downstream collusion by virtue of licensing rates being a very small percentage of the overall end product does not mean that there might not be anticompetitive upstream effects vis-à-vis buyer collusion that warrant concern separate from issues related to the sharing of competitively sensitive information. Indeed, as U.S. antitrust officials have noted, not only has the Commission “spoken quite a bit about buyer side cartels and that problem” but the Commission’s letter appears to have been issued under a 2025 European automotive plan, which raises the question of whether it was motivated by “trade law or national champion” concerns rather than the antitrust goals of promoting competition and innovation. [20] ITIF is encouraged by the Commission’s evaluation and assessment of its TTBER and accompanying guidelines on technology transfer agreements to ensure that its policies are fostering the competition and innovation that are the fruits of a successful antitrust regime. At bottom, ITIF broadly supports the proposed revisions concerning TTBER market share thresholds for technology markets, the new guidance on data licensing, and the modification of the guidance on technology pools. However, the new guidance on LNGs appears to create a significant risk of false negatives by exempting concerted action that can harm competition and innovation. While ITIF does not oppose a safe harbour for LNGs in principle, additional criteria should be applied to make certain that LNGs exempted from liability under Article 101(1) are sufficiently unlikely to result in collusion either upstream or downstream. Doing so would also help the Commission minimize the ability for the TTBER to be enforced in a way that may be seen by U.S. officials as part of a broader protectionist scheme in high-tech industries, which is particularly important given the Digital Markets Act’s continued and unfortunate targeting of America’s leading technology companies at a time when the U.S. and EU should be working together to counter China’s quest for global techno-economic dominance.

Backfire: Export Controls Helped Huawei and Hurt U.S. Firms Key Takeaways Introduction Huawei 101: Its Businesses and U.S. Actions Against the Company How Huawei Bounced Back From Export Controls How Export Controls On Huawei Are Affecting U.S. Companies Why This Matters Policy Recommendations Conclusions Endnotes,2025-10-27,Rodrigo Balbontin,"Huawei is a more innovative company today than it was before the U.S. government sought to choke its supply chain. This case should serve as a lesson: U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than most think, and sanctions often hurt U.S. competitiveness more than China’s. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Huawei 101: Its Businesses and U.S. Actions Against the Company 4 How Huawei Bounced Back From Export Controls 12 How Export Controls On Huawei Are Affecting U.S. Companies 22 Why This Matters 27 Policy Recommendations 27 Conclusions 29 Endnotes 30 Does the United States have the power to kill Chinese companies? And can it do so without reducing its own techno-economic power? At least regarding Huawei, the answer to both questions is a definite no. Due to cybersecurity concerns, since 2018, the U.S. government has gradually banned the sale of Huawei products for U.S. telecommunications networks and encouraged other nations to do the same. But that was not enough for U.S. policymakers; they sought to kill the company. In 2019, the U.S. government sanctioned Huawei for doing business with adversaries, such as Iran, by taking judicial actions and adding the company to the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List—attempting to cripple Huawei by disrupting its supply chain. Both the Biden and the second Trump administration have continued to sanction the company. The export controls backfired. Huawei is the world’s largest telecom equipment manufacturer, and its global market share for telecom equipment increased from 29 percent in early 2018 to 31 percent by 2024. [1] At the same time, U.S. technology companies such as Intel, Qualcomm, Teradyne, and others lost more than $33 billion in sales to Huawei between 2021 and 2024—in a conservative estimate—weakening these American companies globally while strengthening Chinese or other nations’ tech companies, including Japan. Additionally, due to the restrictions, Huawei launched its OS, HarmonyOS, in 2019, which now has nearly a billion users and is compatible with mobiles, tablets, and laptops—a direct threat to Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows’ global market share. [2] The company is also catching up on chipmaking, claiming that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 different circuit boards. [3] It is also reported that Huawei can substitute Nvidia’s H20 chip, a specific model that meets the U.S. government’s requirements for exporting semiconductors to China—limiting Nvidia’s global sales. [4] As of August 2025, Huawei claimed to have built an entire ecosystem independent of U.S. technologies. [5] Huawei was able to do this because it anticipated these U.S. actions as early as 2012 and invested heavily to offset them. [6] The company’s research and development (R&D) investments grew proportionally more than those of any other major technology company—including Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft—and it increased its reliance on the Chinese market to sustain revenues. In addition, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) provided significant financial support to the company to decouple from the United States after the restrictions were in place. Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S. techno-economic power is weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think. This should be a wake-up call for U.S. policymakers. It’s possible the U.S. government might have been able to cripple Huawei in the late 2000s or early 2010s when its and China’s technological capabilities were significantly weaker. But by the late 2010s, it was too late. As a result, the only outcome was to weaken U.S. technology companies and strengthen Huawei and China’s innovation. Sanctioning Huawei and attempting to cripple the company has proven to be hubristic and self-defeating—U.S. techno-economic power is now weaker than decision-makers in Washington might think. To the extent Huawei poses a cybersecurity threat, excluding it from U.S. networks and urging allies and trade partners to follow suit should have been the sole focus. However, the U.S. government sought to punish Huawei for allegations of doing business with Iran without fully considering the extent of this measure’s cost to U.S. companies and for American techno-economic power. Moreover, the U.S. government’s attempt to cripple Huawei underestimated the extent of the Chinese government’s support for the company, Huawei’s technological advancements, and its ability to source non-U.S. inputs or develop them domestically. The U.S. government’s approach was outdated, not reflecting the current relative power of the United States. This report shows how export controls accelerated Huawei’s innovations and harmed American companies. It first describes the U.S. actions against the company and how the current context differs from the U.S.-Japan technological rivalry of the 1980s, the last time the United States tried to stop the growth of a competitor. The report also provides a brief overview of Huawei’s businesses and its innovations after the export control measures. It then examines how the company overcame the restrictions by receiving support from the PRC and by preparing to offset the measures for over six years. In addition, it highlights how U.S. firms have been directly affected, with lost sales of over $33 billion between 2021 and 2024, and exposure to retaliation by the Chinese government due to these export controls. The report also explains why this backlash against U.S. companies matters in the context of U.S.-China techno-economic competition. Finally, the report proposes a framework to address the global rise of Chinese technology companies: ▪ The United States should press more countries to ban Huawei’s imports. ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies, or not at all. ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power. Huawei is a privately owned company headquartered in Shenzhen, China, with close ties to the Chinese government, and is one of the world’s largest technology companies. [7] The firm reported revenues of $124 billion in 2024, of which information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure accounted for 43 percent, and consumer markets (e.g., smartphones, laptops, wearables, and tablets) accounted for 39 percent. [8] Other areas of the company’s business include smart grids and energy storage technologies, cloud computing, and smart automotive solutions. Starting around 2018, U.S. policymakers viewed the growing presence of Huawei within 5G networks as a cybersecurity threat. Policymakers argued that Huawei’s technologies could enable the Chinese government to conduct espionage through backdoors. [9] To address this concern, the U.S. government imposed a de facto import ban on Huawei through a patchwork of measures. (See table 1.) In addition, the global expansion of the company within 5G networks was also assessed as a cybersecurity concern, prompting the government to launch a diplomatic campaign to urge allies and trade partners to follow suit. [10] Table 1. De facto import bans—actions to exclude Huawei from U.S. 5G networks (2017 to present). [11] Date Measure Instrument December 2017 Prohibition by the U.S. Department of Defense from purchasing products from Huawei or ZTE for covered missions. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2018 May 2018 Ban on retail sales of phones and other telecommunication devices from Huawei and ZTE within U.S. military facilities. U.S. Department of Defense ruling August 2018 Prohibition of all federal procurements from Huawei and ZTE. Additionally, it extended the ban to federal grants, loans, and subsidies, thereby broadening the impact of the restriction to most local government entities. NDAA for fiscal year 2019 May 2019 National emergency declaration due to alleged threats to the national telecommunications supply chain and authorization for the Department of Commerce to ban transactions from organizations considered “foreign adversaries.” Executive Order (EO) 13873 January 2020 Denial of transactions to purchase equipment from companies categorized as a national security threat to any recipient of federal telecommunications subsidies. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling March 2020 Total ban of telecommunication equipment or services that pose a national security risk, and a program to remove any such equipment and services currently used in U.S. networks. Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 June 2020 Ban of Huawei and ZTE from receiving Universal Service Funds (USF), and force potential U.S. fund recipients to remove their equipment. FCC ruling January 2021 Establishment of a review process to potentially ban transactions from companies that pose a national security risk, including Huawei. 2021 Department of Commerce’s to enforcement of EO 13873 January 2021 Forcing of rural carriers to remove and replace Huawei equipment, offering reimbursement. FCC ruling November 2022 Prohibition of allowing Huawei telecom or surveillance equipment to enter the United States through the FCC’s Certification process or any other so-called “backdoors.” FCC ruling December 2024 Amendment and clarification of the January 2021 Department of Commerce’s interim ruling, closing backdoors that allowed Huawei, for example, to update software. Department of Commerce’s final rule implementing EO 13873 May 2025 Prohibition of Chinese labs deemed security risks from testing U.S. electronics. FCC ruling Despite these efforts, many allied countries and nations from the so-called Global South still use Huawei technologies for their 5G infrastructure. (See figure 1.) As of September 2025, over 3.2 billion people outside China resided in countries that use 5G networks that rely on Huawei equipment, while another 370 million live in countries where Huawei is not banned but is absent from their 5G networks. Huawei remains embedded in the 5G networks of nine U.S. allies—Hungary, Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey—and is being phased out from six others: Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania, and the United Kingdom. [12] Among the rest, Huawei’s 5G is banned in 12 countries, and 10 countries have excluded the company without the need for a ban. [13] Figure 1. Prevalence of Huawei technologies in 5G infrastructure outside China [14] In early 2019, Huawei’s alleged business with the Iranian regime, and to a lesser extent with the North Korean regime, led the U.S. government to take action to penalize the company. The efforts taken to punish Huawei caused the U.S. government to lose focus on strengthening America’s power in the context of its techno-economic competition with China. As this report describes in further sections, these actions ultimately weakened U.S. competitiveness by hurting American companies. The U.S. government started judicial and administrative actions to sanction Huawei: ▪ Judicial actions. In January 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed indictments against Huawei and its CFO, Wanzhou Meng, the daughter of the founder, Ren Zhengfei, for bank fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. [15] Meng’s case was dismissed with prejudice in 2022. [16] The broader criminal case against Huawei is expected to begin in early 2026, which also includes allegations of its business dealings with the North Korean government. [17] ▪ Administrative actions. The U.S. Department of Commerce’s BIS announced the inclusion of Huawei and its subsidiaries on the Entity List in May 2019, arguing that the company “has been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.” [18] The specific accusation that led to its inclusion on the Entity List was evasion of sanctions by doing business with the Iranian government. The Entity List is an executive tool used to target foreign individuals and organizations, subject to specific license requirements for the transaction of certain goods. [19] U.S. companies had a significant role in Huawei’s supply chain by the time it was included on the Entity List, and U.S. government officials attempted to “kill” or “cripple” the company using this as leverage. [20] By 2019, American companies accounted for one-third of Huawei’s expenses, with U.S. firms comprising 33 of its top 92 vendor suppliers. [21] These companies provided essential inputs to Huawei, such as chipsets used in headsets and telecommunications networks, equipment, electronic components, OSs, and semiconductor design software. [22] However, the U.S. government underestimated the Chinese government’s support for Huawei and the company’s innovation capabilities to overcome the attempts to damage its supply chain critically. The U.S. government attempted to cripple Huawei by enforcing Entity List-based export controls. The inclusion on the Entity List means a ban on any sale or transfer of U.S. technologies without a license from BIS, including R&D collaboration. The requirement for a license is extended to the export and re-export of all products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), and all applications for licenses are under a “presumption of denial,” meaning the unlikelihood of obtaining exceptions. For Huawei, its inclusion on the Entity List meant that critical inputs from U.S.-based companies would no longer be available, including hardware for its smartphones and other products, as well as software, such as Google Mobile Services. Huawei enjoyed approximately a year and a half of limited breathing room to navigate the 2019 export controls until August 2020. The restrictions that took immediate effect after its inclusion in the Entity List applied to goods subject to the EAR—U.S.-made products and certain foreign goods manufactured using significant U.S. content. In May 2020, BIS expanded the jurisdiction for export controls on foreign-made chips fabricated with U.S. equipment (i.e., expansion of the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule), explicitly citing HiSilicon, a semiconductor subsidiary, as an example of Huawei’s affiliates targeted by these restrictions. [23] Moreover, following the company’s inclusion on the Entity List, BIS issued successive 90-day temporary general licenses (TGLs) that allowed Huawei to continue obtaining certain U.S. technologies, such as software updates. [24] An August 2020 amendment stopped the TGLs and tightened the Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule, including foreign-made chips fabricated “from U.S. technology or software to support the manufacture of indigenous chipsets,” effectively limiting the company’s access to the world’s most advanced chips produced by the Taiwanese firm TSMC. [25] The restrictions after August 2020 included some exceptions, as BIS introduced a permanent authorization for “cybersecurity research and vulnerability disclosure.” For instance, in November 2020, Qualcomm and Intel announced that the U.S. government had granted licenses to sell a limited number of products, including 4G technology for mobile devices; these licenses were later revoked in May 2024. [26] Microsoft received a license allowing it to include Windows in Huawei’s laptops, which expired in March 2025. [27] Additionally, in September 2022, BIS granted a permanent authorization to collaborate with Huawei and its subsidiaries on standards setting and dialogue, aiming to prevent the fragmentation of international 5G and Wi-Fi protocols. [28] In 2022, the Biden administration announced export controls on advanced semiconductors and equipment to slow the Chinese semiconductor industry as a whole—i.e., not targeting specific companies. [29] These measures led some American companies to redesign some of their products to meet U.S. government standards. A notable example is Nvidia’s H20 chip, which is a second-tier version of its advanced data center chips designed to meet the 2022 restrictions. [30] The U.S. government later banned the export of the H20 chip in January 2025—which boosted Huawei's Ascend 910C chips in the Chinese market almost immediately—and later lifted the ban in July of that year. [31] Export Controls During the 1980s U.S.-Japan Technological Competition The United States was once able to halt the growth of entire industries that threatened American global leadership, such as the U.S.-Japan technology rivalry in the 1980s, particularly in the semiconductor sector. But the conditions that led the United States to stop the Japanese semiconductor industry’s growth do not apply to today’s U.S.-China techno-economic competition. The rapid rise of the Japanese economy during the 1980s was viewed as a threat by some U.S. policymakers. Japanese semiconductor, automotive, and consumer electronics companies were quickly gaining global market share, while Japan’s economy was largely inaccessible to American competitors. In 1985, the United States launched a Section 301 investigation—an instrument of the U.S. Trade Act used to impose trade remedies in response to unfair trade practices—against Japan’s semiconductor and electronics industries based on allegations of dumping and currency manipulation, leading to a 100 percent tariff on Japanese electronics. [32] Additionally, in 1986, both countries reached an agreement on semiconductors: Japan committed not to compete against the United States through dumping and allowed U.S. semiconductors to capture a 20 percent share of its domestic market. [33] Some experts consider these measures the “start of the decline for Japan’s semiconductor industry.” [34] Japan’s semiconductor industry grew rapidly during the 1980s, and it temporarily held the majority of the global market between 1986 and 1992. [35] (See figure 2.) The United States was able to regain its global market share through a mix of measures: addressing Japanese unfair trade practices, implementing industrial policies to support the American semiconductor industry, and capitalizing on shifts in global demand toward microprocessors and logic chips. A notable example of how the United States treated this as a public-private effort is the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology (SEMATECH) consortium, created in 1987 by 14 U.S. semiconductor firms, which received $870 million from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). [36] An example of the United States sanctioning a specific Japanese company is the “Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal” in 1986, when it was revealed that Toshiba Machine, a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics manufacturer Toshiba Corporation, had sold sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union (USSR). [37] Toshiba’s tools, combined with those of the Norwegian weapons manufacturer Kongsberg—a company that was also supplying the USSR—were used to reduce the detection of nuclear submarines. [38] Toshiba Machine was sanctioned by the United States in 1988, which banned Toshiba Corp. and Toshiba Machine from public procurement, along with certain Toshiba Machine products, for three years. [39] Figure 2 : U.S. and Japanese global semiconductor market share, by revenues, 1984–2019 [40] The context and effectiveness of the U.S. government’s measures against Japanese companies in the 1980s differ from the ongoing U.S.-China techno-economic rivalry, as summarized in table 2. Table 2: Summary of the U.S.-Japan (1980s) vs. U.S.-China (present day) tech rivalry Context Similarities Differences Geopolitical Both represent contests between the United States and a rising economy. Japan was (and remains) a U.S. ally; China is a strategic rival. Japan cooperated; China retaliates and pushes decoupling. Trade Large bilateral trade deficits drove/drive tensions. Today’s globalized supply chains make restrictions harder to enforce and less effective. Industrial policy Semiconductors were and remain central to competition. The U.S. responded with industrial policies promoting the semiconductor industry (SEMATECH in 1987; CHIPS Act in 2022). U.S.–China rivalry spans more sectors, including advanced and military technologies. Japan’s security risks were product-specific, with few IP theft concerns; contrary to the current concerns about Chinese technology firms. Firm-level support Both relied/rely on “national champions” (Toshiba, Huawei) that benefited/benefit from state support and protected markets. Japanese firms are private conglomerates (keiretsu). Chinese firms are state-owned or closely tied to the CCP. Before the export controls, Huawei and its subsidiaries held a significant global market share in several of their businesses. Huawei has not fully recovered its revenues before the restrictions; however, the company has demonstrated resilience by regaining market share, mainly relying on the Chinese market. Some examples are listed below: ▪ Lower market share on smartphone shipments than before the export controls, but a higher participation in the Chinese market. The company had a 20 percent global market share in smartphone shipments by 2019, which dropped to “virtually zero” after the restrictions, although by December 2024, it had increased to 4 percent. [41] As of April 2025, Huawei was virtually tied with Xiaomi as the most popular mobile phone company in China, with approximately 18 percent market share. [42] ▪ Similar market share in ICT infrastructure before and after export controls. Huawei currently holds at least 31 percent of the global revenue for radio access network (RAN) products, slightly higher than its 30 percent market share in 2016. [43] ▪ Regaining market share in smartphone chipsets. The market share of smartphone chipsets from HiSilicon, Huawei’s semiconductor design subsidiary, peaked in the second quarter of 2020 at 16 percent, making it the third-largest supplier worldwide. However, it dropped to zero in the second quarter of 2022 and rebounded to 4 percent in the first quarter of 2025. [44] After its inclusion in the Entity List, Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies. Notably, the company claims to have developed “an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States.” [45] One of the pillars of this independent ecosystem is Huawei’s in-house built OS, HarmonyOS, which was initially developed as a “backup plan” in case of U.S. restrictions; the company now expects it to become “a third mobile operating system for the world.” [46] HarmonyOS is also compatible with computers, and there are reports that Huawei is rolling out its laptops with this system instead of Microsoft’s Windows. [47] Huawei is focusing on launching products that replace those previously supplied by U.S. companies, and it claims to have developed “an ecosystem entirely independent of the United States.” Cutting off Android and Windows OS helped create and accelerate the deployment of Huawei’s OS. HarmonyOS runs on over 1 billion devices, and supports smartphones, laptops, tablets, and over 1,000 peripheral devices such as printers. [48] Huawei is exploring using HarmonyOS in other developments, such as microsatellites—and with its new generation, HarmonyOS NEXT, the firm expects to complete the decoupling from Western-led OSs. [49] According to Chinese media, HarmonyOS was developed with the collaboration of 20 research institutes and 10,000 engineers, and the effort has registered over 2,700 patents. Some Western companies operating in China, such as BMW, have already partnered with Huawei to incorporate its OS into their next-generation vehicles. [50] The effort to build an indigenous OS aligns closely with the PRC’s goals of technological self-reliance and challenges Western dominance in global markets. Android and Apple’s iOS account for nearly 99 percent of the worldwide smartphone market, and Apple, Google, and Microsoft together account for more than 90 percent of the laptop OSs’ share. [51] Moreover, OpenHarmony, the software upon which HarmonyOS is based, is managed by the OpenAtom Foundation, a Chinese government-controlled organization. [52] Huawei is also investing in reducing its reliance on foreign chipmaking technologies. The company claims that in 2023 it was able to replace more than 13,000 components and redesign over 4,000 circuit boards. [53] HiSilicon designed a 7 nanometer (nm) chip that compensates for its lower computing power by utilizing HarmonyOS and began deploying this chip in its devices in 2023. [54] Huawei’s AI chip, Ascend 910d, is expected to perform on par with Nvidia’s H100, one of the company’s most advanced products, yet at nearly 60–70 percent of its cost. [55] However, some reports estimate that Huawei lags significantly behind Western chipmakers, such as Nvidia and AMD, and will struggle to compete outside China. [56] Reports suggest that Huawei can substitute Nvidia’s H20 chip with the Ascend 920 model, announced in April 2025. [57] It is expected that Huawei will become China's top AI chipmaker by 2026, with the opening of three new plants. [58] Despite this, the company will not have the necessary scale to meet demand in the Chinese market within the next year. [59] In addition, Nvidia reported halting H20 chip production in August 2025 due to significant pushback from the Chinese government, and reports suggest that Chinese technology companies have been banned from acquiring it since September 2025 due to cybersecurity concerns. [60] The company is also opening new product lines, directly competing against U.S. firms. For example, Huawei’s smart driving solutions have been implemented in at least half a million cars, and some analysts suggest its technology is superior to Tesla’s. [61] The Huawei MateBook X Pro and Huawei’s Watch D also offer features and specifications that are often considered equal to or superior to those of Western competitors. [62] The export controls did not take into account the Chinese government’s efforts to secure the company’s survival. There is precedent for the Chinese government intervening to rescue the company. Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder and president, stated that “Huawei would no longer exist” without protectionist policies to shield it from foreign competitors during its internationalization efforts in the 2000s. [63] At that time, Chinese-backed loans, such as those from the China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China, aided Huawei’s international expansion, allowing the company to outbid competitors and adopt a “vacuum-cleaner approach … just sucking up the market.” [64] Over the 2010s, Huawei and state-owned ZTE artificially gained market share from Ericsson and Nokia in telecommunications equipment through direct support from the Chinese government, as well as indirect support such as restricting foreign companies’ access to the expanding Chinese market. [65] Following the U.S. export controls in 2019, Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC through financial support, direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies, and a continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives. Huawei’s success stands on the shoulders of Chinese innovation mercantilism. By 2019, Huawei had received $75 billion in state support since its establishment, including $1.6 billion in grants, $46.3 billion in credit facilities, $25 billion in tax breaks, and $2 billion in subsidized land purchases. [66] This helped the company gain market share, particularly in the global telecommunications equipment market. The company has also benefited from various other types of government support, including its role as a recipient of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects, which helped the company expand its global footprint and build the necessary connections to navigate restrictions. [67] The Chinese government has implemented various practices to support Huawei and other national champions, including protecting the domestic market, undervaluing the currency, promoting exports, and ignoring intellectual property (IP) theft. [68] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) has a longstanding record of reporting on how the PRC has subsidized Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, such as ZTE. Huawei’s and ZTE’s global market share, primarily accumulated during the 2010s, was a direct result of China’s mercantilist policies and programs, such as closing China’s market to foreign companies, thereby securing a sizable customer base. [69] A 2020 ITIF study found that if Ericsson and Nokia had captured Huawei’s and ZTE’s equivalent market shares, the world would have seen a 20 percent increase in telecommunications equipment R&D investments and 75 additional essential 5G patents. [70] Hence, Chinese state support for Huawei not only helps advance China’s agenda of techno-economic dominance at the expense of Western incumbents, but also undermines overall global innovation. Following its inclusion in the Entity List in 2019, Huawei continues to receive support from the PRC. For example, the company has received more than 215 billion yuan ($30 billion) from the central and Shenzhen governments to acquire two chip plants and to build at least three others. [71] The PRC’s continued support is reflected in several additional ways: ▪ Favorable financial support to mitigate the effects of the export controls . HONOR, a former Huawei subsidiary, is a budget-brand smartphone whose business was heavily affected by U.S. restrictions, as it relied on U.S. semiconductors for its hardware and had access to the Google Play Store for its software. [72] HONOR was acquired in 2020 for 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) by a consortium of private and state-backed investors. [73] In this transaction, the Chinese government acted as the “investor of first resort,” allowing Huawei to divest from an asset subject to export controls under its ownership, while the PRC government secured the continuation of production for a company that, after the acquisition, was able to keep importing foreign chips. [74] ▪ Direct procurement from state-owned Chinese companies . The PRC has consistently favored China’s national champions through the procurement of public agencies or state-owned companies. For example, in 2021, China Mobile, a state-owned Chinese telecommunications company, announced that Huawei would be the vendor for 60 percent of 5G network station contracts. [75] (ZTE acquired nearly 30 percent, while Western competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia received the remaining few contracts.) China Mobile allocated Huawei 52 percent of a $1.1 billion contract for 5G network deployment between 2023 and 2024. [76] (Ericsson and Nokia received 13 percent of the resources; notably, another Chinese state-owned company, Datang Mobile, received awards in addition to ZTE.) What ITIF stated in 2020 remains valid in 2025: “The only reason a non-Chinese firm is allowed to gain 5G market share is to continue the illusion of an open competitive market, and to give the Chinese government leverage over European governments that seek to limit Huawei deployment in Europe. If the EU threatens to take strong action against unfair Chinese practices, the Chinese government can retaliate by threatening to completely exclude European providers.” [77] ▪ Continued preferential treatment as a “national champion” for strategic national initiatives . Huawei has been one of the primary beneficiaries of China’s industrial policies aimed at promoting the country’s strategic industry upgrades. For instance, the 2023 expansion of the semiconductor R&D tax incentive served as a de facto subsidy for Huawei and HiSilicon (Huawei’s semiconductor design subsidiary), among others, since semiconductor R&D expenditure can yield up to a 220 percent deduction from the company’s taxable income. [78] In 2023, the PRC designated Huawei—along with Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC), Naura, and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC)—as targets for increased governmental support for semiconductors, without requiring the demonstration of performance objectives. [79] (To be sure, semiconductor tax credits can be legitimate tools for nations to use to promote their semiconductor industries, so long as those tax credits are made available equally to companies from all countries competing in a nation’s market.) Since 2012, Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions, invested heavily in R&D, developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software, and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions. ITIF noted in 2020 that export controls were “shooting U.S. exporters in the foot,” as they went beyond protecting the U.S. telecommunications networks for cybersecurity reasons, limited U.S. company exports, and incentivized Huawei “to produce its own inputs, including computer chips.” [81] This assessment proved to be accurate. Moreover, the export controls overlooked that Huawei had prepared for a restrictions scenario for over six years before the company was added to the Entity List in 2019. Notably, a 2012 U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence special report revealed the company’s unfair practices and its ties with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) acted as an early warning. [82] Since 2012, Huawei has shifted toward greater reliance on the Chinese domestic market to buffer against restrictions, invested heavily in R&D, developed capabilities to produce in-house critical hardware and software, and stockpiled resources to survive the first year after restrictions. A year after the 2012 House report, Huawei initiated an aggressive public relations campaign in the United States to improve its image. When the campaign did not lessen the scrutiny over the company’s practices and cybersecurity concerns, it officially declared that it was “not interested in the U.S. market anymore,” noting that its U.S. market sales were only $1 billion. [83] (This ignored the fact that the company relied heavily on U.S. technology components for all its operations.) While the 2000s were a decade of international expansion for Huawei, the company reversed this trend in the subsequent decade. Before the 2008 global financial crisis, Huawei’s global expansion led to a significant increase in its non-Chinese revenues, jumping from 21 percent in 2005 to 75 percent in 2008. As the shock from the crisis led the company to increase its share in Chinese markets by 15 percentage points from 2008 to 2009, Huawei slowly recovered its income from non-Chinese markets by 2011. However, since 2012, Huawei has significantly expanded its presence and increasingly relied on revenues from China. By 2019, China represented 59 percent of Huawei’s revenues, and in its latest 2024 annual report, China provided 71 percent of revenues. Figure 3: Huawei’s revenues from China as a share of total revenues [84] While revenues from China have increased in relative terms for the company since 2012, revenues from the rest of the world also rose in the years leading up to the U.S. restrictions. As shown in figure 4, Huawei’s global revenues increased 2.5 times between 2011 and 2020, the years when revenues peaked. However, revenues generated in China grew sixfold during this period, whereas revenues from non-Chinese markets rose by 78 percent. Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls. During the first year after them, revenues from China increased by 12 percent, offsetting the 14 percent decline in non-Chinese markets, which enabled Huawei to report an overall year-over-year increase. In the following years, revenues from China bounced back rapidly. Between 2019 and 2024, revenues from China increased by 4 percent, while revenues from non-Chinese markets declined by 7 percent. Figure 4: Huawei’s revenues by region (billion CNY, 2024 prices) [85] Revenues from China have served as a buffer to offset the impact of U.S. export controls. One example of how the Chinese market has served as a buffer is Huawei’s market share for smartphone devices. The company once dominated the Chinese smartphone market, accounting for 37 percent and 38 percent of total sales in 2019 and 2020, respectively. As the export controls affected the firm’s production, by 2021, this market share had fallen to approximately 5 percent. Considering that HONOR spun off from Huawei through the previously described state-supported acquisition, the comparison of post-restrictions market share should involve both companies. In this context, despite a challenging 2021, the combined market share of Huawei and HONOR in China averaged 29 percent for the 2022 to 2024 period. (See figure 5.) As of 2025, Huawei’s market share in this sector has virtually tied with Xiaomi, making it one of the two most dominant ICT companies in China. Figure 5: Huawei’s market share in China for smartphone sales [86] Huawei outperformed all its competitors in terms of R&D investment before the U.S. restrictions. Between 2013 (the first full year after the October 2012 House report on Huawei) and 2020, Huawei increased its real R&D expenditure by more than threefold, surpassing that of any other peer company, as shown in figure 6. Regardless of whether this investment—which exceeded that of the rest of the industry—was motivated by global expansion or by the fact that Huawei executives were indeed accounting for restrictions risks, in practice, these years of R&D overspending allowed the company to build a knowledge base to confront the restrictions challenge. Figure 6: Real R&D expenditure growth by company (indexed; 2013 = 100) [87] Growth in Huawei’s R&D expenditures declined after the restrictions, yet it still set a record for the company in 2023 and 2024. [88] Huawei’s efforts to develop (or catch up with) frontier technologies have not diminished. One way to approximate this is by examining R&D intensity, which considers the company’s R&D expenditure as a share of total revenues for a given year. Huawei had historically lagged behind in corporate R&D compared to competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia. [89] However, as figure 7 shows, U.S. restrictions forced the company to increase its R&D intensity to an average of 20 percent between 2019 and 2023, outperforming all competitors except Intel (which competes with Huawei only in one of Huawei’s businesses: semiconductors). Figure 7: R&D intensity by company (R&D expenditure as a share of net sales) [90] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS. Additionally, Huawei increased its number of R&D personnel since the U.S. restrictions were imposed, hiring more than 17,000 employees in this field between 2019 and 2024. (See figure 8.) While Huawei’s R&D staff accounted for 45 percent of the total staff count during the five years preceding the restrictions (2014–2018), this proportion rose to an average of 55 percent in the five years following the U.S. inclusion of the company on the Entity List (2020–2024). There is no available information about the specific units or research projects to which these additional R&D researchers have been assigned. Figure 8: Number of R&D employees and R&D personnel as a share of total employees for Huawei [91] The export control for software, in practice, began in August 2020 after BIS stopped granting the TGL. [92] This meant that Huawei would lose access to all non-open-source dealings, such as licensing for Google’s Android OS, Google’s Play Store app ecosystem, and any other software-related business with U.S.-headquartered companies. Huawei sold its handsets with Android Open Source Project in China (since Google’s services were blocked in the country due to censorship) and the Google-certified Android OS for the rest of the world as the integrated OS. Microsoft enjoyed a license until March 2025, allowing it to include Windows OS in Huawei’s laptops. [93] Huawei took advantage of the TGL granted after its designation to the Entity List to release HarmonyOS in August 2019. The company had previously explored using another OS instead of Android, such as Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS or Samsung’s Tizen in 2014. [94] Huawei explicitly built its in-house OS in anticipation of potential U.S. restrictions—two months before the restrictions, a spokesperson stated, “Huawei does have backup systems but only for use in extenuating circumstances.” [95] Some reports indicate that the company has been prepared for “worst-case scenarios” since the 2012 House report. [96] Evidence suggests that the firm was preparing for an indigenous OS as early as 2013–2014. For example, LiteOS, an OS for real-time Internet-of-Things devices, was launched in 2015. [97] Some of the functions of LiteOS used to build HarmonyOS and its open-source version, OpenHarmony, are described as its direct predecessors. [98] Similarly, the technology enabling cross-device tasks and efficient resource allocation scheduling for the OS patent application dates back to May 2015, suggesting that at least part of the research was conducted in 2014 or earlier. [99] Huawei developed semiconductor capabilities to achieve self-sufficiency in the event of U.S. restrictions. To achieve this goal, the company took three clear actions: invested in its main chip design subsidiary (HiSilicon), began working with companies that have complementary strengths in the semiconductor supply chain, and created incentives to develop an ecosystem within China through an investment platform. HiSilicon, fully owned by and originating as a spin-off of Huawei in the 2000s, served as the cornerstone of Huawei’s backup plans for chips. The day after the export controls were announced in May 2019, HiSilicon’s CEO sent a letter warning that the company had been preparing a “spare tire” for the survival of Huawei. [100] HiSilicon provided Huawei with the organizational and staffing capabilities to develop physical components that could replace U.S. technologies. By 2012, HiSilicon had developed at least 120 chip designs and distributed at least 150 million chips. [101] HiSilicon has been developing chips branded as Kirin since 2014 and helped design the world’s first 7 nm chipset commercialized with 5G support, Kirin 980, in 2018 in partnership with TSMC. [102] HiSilicon produced more than $7 billion worth of chips during the period before the 2019 restrictions. [103] The second action taken was to collaborate with companies that have complementary capabilities. For example, in 2015, Huawei announced a joint venture with SMIC (a partially state-owned Chinese company), Imec (a Belgian research consortium), and Qualcomm (a U.S. semiconductor company) called SMIC Advanced Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation. This joint venture, majority owned by SMIC, focused on R&D to develop 14 nm semiconductor technology for mass production by 2020. [104] SMIC announced the start of volume production for the 14 nm chip in late 2019, and the first commercialization took place in 2020 with HiSilicon’s 14 nm Kirin 710A chip. [105] Finally, Huawei sought to build a local ecosystem of suppliers to strengthen China’s self-sufficiency in semiconductors. In 2019, before Huawei’s inclusion on the Entity List, the company launched Hubble, a venture capital subsidiary designed as an investment vehicle for semiconductor startups, with a registered capital exceeding $100 million. Before the establishment of Hubble, Huawei had maintained a practice of not investing in third-party companies. [106] To date, Hubble has invested in at least 100 startups. [107] For example, it is an investor in companies developing key semiconductor fabrication processes, such as Focuslight Technologies (a photolithography equipment maker), Suzhou Everbright Photonics (a gallium-nitride chipmaker), and Xuzhou Chemicals (which develops photoresist technologies used in lithography). [108] Hubble is currently being used to further promote Huawei’s ecosystem by funding startups that would be locked into it, for instance, by investing in humanoid robots that can integrate the company’s new developments in chips (Huawei’s Ascend AI chips), large language models (Pangu), and HarmonyOS. [109] The cumulative congressional and executive actions raising concerns about Huawei during late 2017 onward allowed the company to take actions to mitigate potential U.S. measures against it. For example, Huawei’s inventories of raw materials expanded by more than 86 percent from 2017 to 2018, and the company has kept a high level of stockpiles of raw materials since the restrictions relative to other inventories. (See figure 9.) These raw materials include electronic components and sub-assemblies used in manufacturing telecommunication equipment and consumer devices, as well as large orders of the 7 nm Tiangang core chips, manufactured by TSMC using U.S. wafer fabrication equipment and supplying Huawei until the end of the TGL. [110] These inventory levels allowed the company to effectively boost its revenues during the first year after it was added to the Entity List, in addition to other measures such as issuing bonds in the Chinese market for over $800 million to increase liquidity and reduce its financial reliance on foreign markets. [111] Figure 9: Huawei’s raw materials as a share of total inventories [112] The U.S. actions against Huawei served as an incentive for the company to accelerate its decoupling from U.S. technologies. U.S. exports to Huawei exceeded $11 billion when the firm was added to the Entity List. [113] Without those inputs, it created a “void” in Huawei’s supply chain that was mostly filled by Huawei’s in-house processes or Chinese technologies. Restrictions against the company harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them. ITIF estimates that restrictions on doing business with Huawei caused U.S. companies to lose at least $33 billion in sales between 2021 and 2024. This estimation is based on two main priors. Before U.S. restrictions, Huawei spent roughly 33 percent of its operating costs on American suppliers. [114] Following the August 2020 amendment to terminate the TGLs, BIS authorized a limited number of export licenses from 2021 to 2024; however, this information is not publicly available. [115] Anecdotal evidence suggests that Huawei purchased between 5 and 10 percent of its operating costs from U.S. firms during this period; ITIF conservatively estimates that share to be 15 percent. [116] To model what would have happened without the export controls, ITIF combined two different types of alternatives for Huawei, creating a total of four different estimations, summarized in figure 10. The first case involves trying to infer what Huawei’s growth would be without U.S. restrictions. To do this, ITIF modeled two scenarios: the “current sales” scenario (using existing data on Huawei’s performance) and a “no export controls scenario,” which assumes that Huawei’s sales would follow the same pattern as the average of its main Western competitors (Alphabet, Apple, Ericsson, Nokia, and Microsoft) from 2021–2024. The second consideration for Huawei in this analysis is whether the company was already on a path to decouple from U.S. technologies, regardless of U.S. actions. To explore this, ITIF modeled two cases: a base case wherein U.S. firms accounted for roughly 33 percent of Huawei’s operating costs for all years (business-as-usual suppliers, or “BAU suppliers,” scenario) and a “decoupling scenario,” assuming Huawei would fully decouple from U.S. technologies by 2027—the 100th anniversary of the PLA. Figure 10. Lost sales to U.S. suppliers due to export controls against Huawei between 2021 and 2024 (billions) [117] Sales from U.S. firms to Huawei helped sustain American market share in key technology products and funded R&D projects, preventing China from capturing that share. At the industry level, Huawei often did not represent a significant portion of the revenues of American advanced manufacturing companies. (See table 3.) However, these sales helped U.S. companies reach the necessary volumes and margins to invest in innovation, ultimately maintaining competitiveness and market share. Restrictions against Huawei directly harmed U.S. businesses by reducing sales of former Huawei suppliers and triggering retaliation from the PRC against them. The restrictions also had a secondary effect on American companies supplying Huawei. Many of them reported in their annual statements that U.S. action negatively impacted the overall demand for their products. For example, Analog Devices Inc., an American semiconductor company, reported in its 2020 annual report that restrictions were “causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers.” [118] Table 4: Examples of U.S. advanced manufacturing companies affected by the export controls [119] Company Example of What It Supplied to Huawei Relevant Financial Information Analog Devices Inc. Chips used in radio systems for 5G telecommunications networks Sales to Huawei represented between 2 and 3 percent of total sales by 2020. Broadcom Wireless communication chips for smartphones and other devices Huawei represented 4 percent of Broadcom’s revenues in 2019, or $900 million. Cadence Electronic design automation software (EDA), also provided to HiSilicon In May 2025, the U.S. government imposed new export controls on EDA sales to Chinese companies. Intel License to ship laptop central processors to Huawei in 2020 (revoked in 2024) When the 2024 license was revoked, Intel maintained its revenue expectation for the year, but “below the midpoint” between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion. Micron Technology Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) Huawei represented 13 percent of revenues by February 2019. Qorvo Radio frequency (RF) supplier for Huawei handsets and base stations Huawei accounted for 13 percent of 2019 revenues, 10 percent in 2020, and 5 percent in 2021, after which it stopped reporting significant sales. Qualcomm License in 2020 to sell older 4G chips to Huawei (revoked in 2024) Between October 2023 and May 2024, revenues from Huawei represented $560 million (1.4 percent for the fiscal year ending in September 2024) Texas Instruments Analog chips for Huawei smartphones and telecom equipment Sales to Huawei represented between 3 and 4 percent of total sales in 2019. Giving Away Market Share to a Foreign Competitor: The Case of Teradyne Teradyne is an American manufacturing company specializing in Automated Test Equipment (ATE) for the semiconductor industry. ATE plays a critical role in semiconductor manufacturing, as it guarantees essential quality controls during the different stages of the process. Teradyne, along with its Japanese competitor Advantest, together account for roughly 80–90 percent of the global market for semiconductor testers in many segments. [120] Teradyne is also a global leader in advanced robotics through its subsidiary Universal Robots. [121] As the export controls against Huawei limited the supply of U.S. technologies to the firm, but were not coordinated with allies, Teradyne was impacted, but its Japanese competitor was not. Thus, Huawei replaced Teradyne’s inputs with Advantest’s, giving up global market share. [122] Advantest’s global market share for semiconductor testers grew from 43 percent in 2020 to 58 percent in 2024, while Teradyne’s declined roughly in a similar, inverse proportion. [123] The restrictions have also harmed Teradyne’s ability to keep investing in innovation capabilities. The company observed two consecutive years of revenue decline, from $3.7 billion in 2021 to $2.7 billion in 2023. As of September 2025, it had not recovered its pre-restriction sales. This revenue loss has impacted the firm’s innovation capabilities. Figure 11 shows the R&D expenditure for Advantest and Teradyne, indexed in 2020, when restrictions began. After the restrictions came into effect for ATE products, Advantest was able to expand its R&D expenditure by roughly 50 percent, while Teradyne observed a decrease in real R&D expenditure. Figure 11 . R&D expenditure (indexed; 2020 = 100). [124] U.S. restrictions also compelled American companies to cancel their contracts with Huawei, such as the earlier removal of Google’s Play Store from Huawei devices. This meant that Huawei’s wearables could not be updated to meet Google’s security and development standards. [125] A similar pattern occurred with Microsoft and its laptop OS, the Windows series. Windows’ license to Huawei expired in March 2025, giving the Chinese company enough time to incorporate HarmonyOS into its laptops. [126] After March 2025, reports indicate that Huawei is only rolling out laptops using its in-house-built OS, HarmonyOS, threatening Microsoft’s market share. [127] While there has not been a formal retaliation from the Chinese government against the United States due to Huawei’s inclusion on the Entity List, the PRC has since taken actions that effectively serve as a response to the restrictions. A few months after the restrictions were imposed in 2019, Cisco executives declared that the company was “uninvited” to compete in bids by Chinese state-owned companies. [128] Thus, Cisco was de facto barred from continuing to sell telecommunications infrastructure to Chinese carriers. (Cisco still sells equipment to other Chinese companies, such as electric vehicle makers.) [129] In December 2019, the PRC instructed all government agencies to phase out foreign-made technologies, including hardware and software, by 2022. [130] This measure was directly targeted at reducing the market share of American firms, such as Dell, HP, and Microsoft, while being functional to the PRC’s goal of technological self-sufficiency. Likewise, local governments in China, such as Shenzhen, started promoting the adoption of HarmonyOS as their primary system, under the “Shenzhen Action Plan for Supporting the Development of Native HarmonyOS Open Source Applications in 2024,” which is seen as a basis for a nation-wide initiative to phase out American OS. [131] In addition, the PRC established its version of the Entity List in May 2019, called the “Unreliable Entity List,” with a justification similar to that of the American version. [132] This tool provides the PRC with a legal basis to target retaliatory measures against specific companies, primarily American ones. The Unreliable Entity List uniquely includes American companies, and it has been utilized by the Chinese government as a “bargaining tool” during ongoing trade negotiations, highlighting the retaliatory nature of the measure. [133] The U.S.–China techno-economic rivalry plays out across every strategic sector, including those in which Huawei competes with American firms for global market share. As ITIF has reported, China is rapidly catching up with the United States in robotics, electronic displays, and artificial intelligence, and it lags behind in machine tools and semiconductors. [134] These are all critical links in Huawei’s supply chain. Because U.S. policy has shaped Huawei’s innovation path, its continued growth erodes America’s competitive edge. The business opportunity loss for American firms doing business with Huawei ultimately matters for the U.S. public interest for three reasons: 1. The acceleration of Huawei’s decoupling from using U.S. technologies impacts American global market share in key products, such as OSs. 2. The loss of revenues from doing business with Huawei undermines American competitiveness, as it limits U.S. firms’ ability to reinvest in R&D and advanced production. [135] 3. The acceleration of Huawei’s decoupling from U.S. technologies is leading to a lock-in of consumers to products within an ecosystem that privileges Chinese standards and supply chains. U.S. technology companies are now in a weaker position to lead globally due to Huawei’s accelerated decoupling. As Nokia and Ericsson were ultimately unable to offset the unfair competition against Huawei and ZTE in 5G, this pattern will likely repeat for the cases of HarmonyOS, the new generation of Huawei’s wearables competing against American firms, or both. The result is likely to be a decline in global market share for companies such as Google and Microsoft. The rationale used by the U.S. government’s actions against Huawei is a legacy of an earlier era, when America could impose sanctions without significantly harming its competitiveness and could hinder the production capabilities of its adversaries. This framework is outdated, as global supply chains have become increasingly complex and Chinese techno-economic power has reached, in some cases, unassailable levels. The United States needs a realistic approach. The fact that the United States is incapable of crippling a company such as Huawei does not preclude the need to take actions against Chinese mercantilism. A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited, targeted export controls on advanced technologies. Some of the measures that U.S. policymakers should consider for this modern framework include the following: ▪ Press more countries to ban Huawei’s imports . In 2020, ITIF recommended that the U.S. government urge its allies to exclude Huawei and ZTE from their markets, particularly in the telecommunications network infrastructure and equipment sector, to counter the companies’ artificial competitiveness resulting from Chinese support and the lack of opportunities for rivals to access the Chinese domestic market. [136] This assessment has not changed. Despite foreign policy’s efforts across multiple U.S. administrations, Huawei remains in many European markets—even as its predatory practices have particularly harmed Ericsson and Nokia. Some allies are phasing out Huawei from their 5G network. Germany, for example, plans to phase out Huawei from core 5G networks by 2026 and from the radio and management layers by 2029. [137] However, nine U.S. allies—Hungary, Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Spain, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, and Turkey—continue to use Huawei in their 5G infrastructure without a plan to phase out the company entirely. The U.S. government needs to reverse course on its go-it-alone approach to competitiveness and start to bring in a “coalition of the willing” that understands the threat to the West from Chinese national power industry predation and is willing to take collective steps in self-defense. One such step should be to ban further sales of Huawei telecom equipment. A modern framework should pair import bans for cybersecurity reasons with limited, targeted export controls on advanced technologies. ▪ Export controls should be applied jointly with allies, or not at all. Export controls, in part, were ineffective because regulatory loopholes allowed Huawei to fully offset American inputs of the same cost and quality as those of U.S. allies, including Japan. As this report shows, blanket export controls on Huawei have undermined American competitiveness in markets where the company has other substitutes, such as the case of ATE for chipmaking tests. This experience demonstrates that unilateral export controls, besides being ineffective and harmful to U.S. companies, actually work to the advantage of American allies. ▪ Export control measures must consider impacts on U.S. firms and techno-economic power . For decades, U.S. foreign policy makers and mavens were willing to spend U.S. techno-economic power to achieve foreign policy goals, such as sanctioning a country we wanted to punish, such as Iran. America can no longer afford such spending of its “technology capital.” Huawei’s experience demonstrates that export controls are detrimental to the United States in both absolute and relative terms: they reduced the resources available for U.S. companies to invest in R&D and innovation, and helped shape Huawei as a competitor in new products, such as OSs, which now threaten U.S. dominance in this global market. It is time for an intellectual and operational reset. U.S. policymakers cannot assume that the United States maintains global leadership in advanced sectors. American competitiveness is faltering and requires a coordinated strategy, led by the federal government, to reverse this trend. The approach taken by the U.S. government against Huawei, with export controls to sanction the company and cripple it, was hubristic—and ultimately backfired. An import ban on Huawei’s 5G network in the United States, along with urging allies and trade partners to follow suit, would have addressed the cybersecurity concerns about the company. Yet, the measures went beyond. The U.S. government took actions against the company for its alleged business with adversaries, such as Iran, which turned out to be costly for U.S. firms and damaging to American competitiveness. It later tried to cripple the company, underestimating Huawei’s innovation capabilities and the PRC’s support. Moreover, as this report shows, a 2012 Congressional report denouncing the company’s predatory practices and cybersecurity risks served as an early warning that prompted the company to invest in decoupling from U.S. technologies. Huawei’s resiliency threatens American competitiveness and market share. After the implementation of export controls, the company has successfully launched its in-house OS, HarmonyOS, which is now being rolled out on mobile devices, tablets, and laptops—potentially threatening U.S. firms’ market share in these sectors. The company is also catching up in chipmaking and exploring new business lines, such as energy storage technologies and smart automotive solutions. Additionally, this report demonstrates how export restrictions harm U.S. companies, resulting in over $33 billion in lost sales and, in some cases, a relative reduction in R&D investments. The failure of U.S. policies against Huawei evidences an outdated rationale to address Chinese mercantilism. The current U.S.-China techno-economic competition differs significantly from earlier episodes when U.S. technological leadership was challenged. For example, the United States regained its semiconductor lead during the U.S.-Japan rivalry of the 1980s and today commands nearly five times Japan’s global market share. It succeeded by combining restrictions, diplomacy with an allied partner (Japan), and sustained innovation. None of those conditions applies today: Chinese support offsets restrictions, the rivalry is with an adversary rather than an ally, and China has caught up or even pulled ahead in many strategic technologies. In other words, the United States is using yesterday’s tools against a fundamentally different adversary; it needs a realistic, not hubristic, policy approach. Acknowledgments Huawei’s building “spare tires” in anticipation of U.S. sanctions is based on the company’s own statements, notably by Ren Zhengfei in 2019. However, the broader narrative of Huawei’s preparations for U.S. restrictions and the “spare tire” concept was first fully documented and gained broad attention through detailed reporting in Eva Dou’s book House of Huawei: The Secret History of China’s Most Powerful Company . “Backfire,” the title of this report, is also the title of one of Annabel Yao’s singles.

An automated system alerts emergency room staff that an incoming patient has a blood-borne pathogen based on their electronic health record, allowing the hospital to prepare additional safety precautions. An electronic system tracks staff as they enter patients’ rooms, reminding them if they forgot to wash their hands as they move between patients. And wearable health monitors tracking heart rate data and other indicators of stress and fatigue recommend when staff should take breaks to ensure that they stay healthy and provide optimal care. [1] This vision of a technology-forward workplace in which an invisible layer of algorithms supports and protects workers is not science fiction. It is increasingly realizable with today’s technology, building on decades of developments miniaturizing computers, sensors, and batteries, as well as improvements in networks and machine learning technologies. [2] The same is true for other industries and workplaces, from capital- and labor- intensive factories to white-collar offices. Technology—including data, hardware, and software—that can enhance workplace safety, accessibility, productivity, and convenience is quickly maturing. However, U.S. policy at the federal and state levels is woefully behind and not advancing at a fast enough pace to realize this potential. Current policy discussions about the future of work are inadequately narrow to keep up with the rate of advancement in emergent workplace technology. These discussions are also counterproductive, fixated almost exclusively around critics’ claims that data-collecting workplace technology is a means to one end: worker surveillance. What this problematic narrative does is both slow down potential upsides from adopting these technologies and fuel unproductive regulation. A productive policy approach to the advent of emergent workplace technology would focus on two overarching goals: 1) accelerating development, testing, and adoption of innovative workplace technology and 2) supporting positive uses of the technology while mitigating negative ones. This report explores the future of workplace technology and the benefits such technology can bring to both employers and employees. It also considers the role of other stakeholders, such as technologists and policymakers, in this conversation. Without dismissing drawbacks that come with a more automated, data-driven workplace environment, this report instead explores options that policymakers have to incentivize worker benefits in the limited window before wider adoption of these technologies takes place. It also looks at the current state of federal and state policy governing the usage of workplace technology and concludes with practical policy recommendations that aim to spur discussion and new approaches to this topic. Specifically, policymakers should recognize the potential of data-rich workplaces by aiming to simultaneously boost workplace technology research and development (R&D) and increase adoption with outlined employer responsibilities and worker protection measures. To do so, the Center for Data Innovation recommends the following: ▪ Establish a federal framework clarifying lawful uses of workplace data and distinguishing protective from invasive technologies. ▪ Boost workplace technology R&D through dedicated federal funding and pilot programs. ▪ Leverage federal procurement to accelerate adoption of safety- and productivity-enhancing technologies. ▪ Modernize workplace safety standards with flexible, outcome-based rules and voluntary tech-enhanced programs. ▪ Direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to evaluate positive impacts of workplace technologies alongside risks. ▪ Reshape public narratives on surveillance and create a nonregulatory oversight body for workplace technology. ▪ Expand data collection on adoption, use, and workforce impacts of next-generation workplace technologies. ▪ Target state and local policies to high-risk contexts, incentivizing protective and beneficial technology adoption. Globally, researchers are rapidly inventing and developing technologies that can help white- and blue-collar workplaces become digitized, automated, and data-driven. Yet, the United States is squandering this transformation. As shown in figure 1 through figure 4, corporate adoption of next-generation workplace technology is low across the United States, the global rate of invention and research toward workplace technologies is growing quickly, especially for software applications, and U.S. organizations that have adopted workplace technology are mostly limited to large manufacturing companies. In response to this technological reality, policymakers’ one-dimensional and skeptical approach has been counterproductive, and will not benefit workers or workplace technology’s potential. Efforts to label and regulate these technologies as only surveillance tools will conversely threaten to keep the private sector’s adoption rate of the technologies low and cost workers unrealized and transformative health, safety, and work experience benefits they might otherwise be able to gain from further adoption. Ideally, the conversation in policymaking circles should move past a framing of surveillance and toward a new era of technology-enhanced workplaces. While surveillance should not be discounted as a potential harm that increased workplace technology adoption poses, exclusively focusing on surveillance would be akin to banning automobiles in the 1920s because they could cause accidents, or rejecting the Internet in the 1990s because it could enable fraud. Like artificial intelligence’s (AI’s) wide applicability to society and business, workplace technology is also an umbrella of different technologies that presents multifaceted use cases, enormous benefits, and risk. A 2024 GAO report epitomizes how this misguided narrative treats all workplace technology as inherently suspect and would prevent the hospital scenario described earlier from becoming reality. [3] Based on public responses submitted to the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) on employers’ usage of automated systems, the GAO report paints a one-sided picture of workplace technology’s impact on U.S. workers. [4] While GAO briefly acknowledged that four commenters—including a union—stated that “employers use digital surveillance tools to prevent or reduce illness,” the report buries these benefits under alarmist framing. [5] GAO decisively titled the accompanying blog “‘Why do I feel like somebody’s watching me?’ Workplace Surveillance Can Impact More Than Just Productivity,” which reinforces a fear-based lens. [6] OSTP’s intent in its study was “to better understand automated surveillance and management of workers … to ensure that these systems do not undermine workers’ rights, opportunities, access, health, or safety.” [7] That is an important goal and, indeed, this study’s data, if publicly released, could be a valuable resource for researchers examining the adoption, ongoing implementation, benefits, and challenges of workplace technology. OSTP’s study should have been accompanied—if not preceded—by additional surveys that explored potential benefits of workplace technology. Unfortunately, the framing of both the OSTP study and GAO’s report reveals a predetermined conclusion that workplace technology is inherently harmful, which ultimately foreclosed a more constructive policy conversation. A central issue in this debate is linguistic. In its report, GAO categorized a wide range of technologies—from cameras and microphones to wearable sensors and braking systems—all as “surveillance.” [8] Almost all technologies collect data, but data collection alone does not equal surveillance. If an employer provides safety equipment with sensors, those sensors collect data on environmental conditions and usage patterns. The data enables safety benefits, but it does not transform the equipment into a surveillance device, nor does it preclude employers from misusing that data for inappropriate monitoring. A thermographic camera might detect early signs of fire risk. A wearable might track worker fatigue to reduce injury. These are examples of electronic monitoring that supports worker safety. Surveillance, by contrast, carries a connotation of suspicion or distrust, implying employer observation aimed at detecting employee wrongdoing or enforcing discipline. For example, an employer using cameras to secure its facility is fundamentally different from one using cameras to monitor what employees eat during their lunch breaks. The issue is not what technology they use, but how they use it and why. Employers can cross a line into surveillance when monitoring becomes disproportionate or punitive, such as tracking workers off-duty. Policymakers should adopt language that reflects this distinction. Otherwise, they will overregulate technologies that help workers and underregulate those that harm them. More useful vocabulary would distinguish between data collection, electronic monitoring, and surveillance based on purpose, transparency, and context. Effective workplace technology policy requires departing from traditional regulatory approaches in three ways: 1. Policymakers should balance innovation for employers and innovation for workers, as unlike consumer technology, workplace technology sits at the intersection of employer efficiency and worker welfare. Traditional policy has often treated worker protection and business needs as oppositional. [9] Policy should instead explicitly support innovations that benefit both employers and workers, rather than framing them as zero-sum trade-offs. 2. Policymakers should regulate usage, not technology. The same sensor that informs a worker when they have walked into a dangerous construction zone becomes problematic if an employer uses it to track employees’ off-duty activities. By contrast, reasonable on-site monitoring—such as ensuring that all staff are accounted for during a fire evacuation—serves a legitimate safety function. Policy should focus on context, purpose, and proportionality rather than banning entire categories of technology. 3. Policymakers should plan for integration stages. Most workplace technology fails not because of the technology itself, but because of poor implementation. Policy should address the full value chain and life cycle—design standards, deployment requirements, and ongoing governance—not just data collection rules. The United States faces a paradox: While workplace technology innovation accelerates globally, U.S. companies are barely adopting these tools. This gap between technological possibility and workplace reality represents a missed opportunity for worker safety and economic competitiveness. Data from the U.S. 2022 Annual Business Survey shows that as of 2021, only approximately 4 percent of surveyed companies had adopted advanced workplace technologies such as human-machine interfaces, autonomous systems, and advanced sensing capabilities, as seen in figure 1. [10] Figure 1: Technology adoption by workplace type, 2021 [11] Meanwhile, as shown in figure 2 and figure 3, patent filings for these same technologies, including both the software that underpins them and developments toward their hardware, have grown steadily, indicating robust innovation that is not reaching U.S. workplaces. The drop in filings in recent years likely reflects reporting and publication lags rather than an actual slowdown. Figure 2: Patent publications of workplace technology software research [12] Figure 3: Patent publications of workplace technology hardware research, 2018–2024 [13] Figure 4 shows that companies with over 5,000 employees adopt workplace technology at significantly higher rates than do smaller companies across all technology categories. In effect, adoption that does exist is heavily concentrated among large manufacturing companies, leaving many American workers without access to beneficial workplace technologies. This concentration creates a two-tier system wherein workers at large manufacturers gain safety and productivity benefits while workers at smaller companies and in service industries are left behind. The hospital scenario described earlier remains out of reach for most U.S. workplaces not because the technology does not exist, but rather because adoption incentives and support systems are inadequate. Figure 4: Workplace technology adoption by company size, 2021 [14] The framing of emerging workplace technologies as tools for employer oversight is only part of the story. When designed and deployed responsibly, these technologies offer measurable gains for workers’ safety, physical and mental health, and work experience. In addition to a short-sighted policymaker view on the future of work and lagging implementation, another problem is that the public debate around workplace technology too often ignores the worker benefits that are already materializing in certain sectors. One of the clearest benefits of workplace technologies is injury prevention. Figure 5 shows that, in 2022, the median nonfatal occupational injuries per 100,000 workers across 52 nations with available data was approximately 686 workers. [15] Globally, the International Labor Organization estimated that in 2019, 374 million workers suffered from nonfatal occupational accidents, with lost work days leading to an estimated loss of 4 percent of the world’s gross domestic product. [16] Figure 5: Non-fatal occupational injuries per 100,000 workers for all economic activity, 2022 [17] In the United States, between January 2015 and December 2023, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recorded 18,312 machinery-related workplace injuries, such as workers getting “caught [or] entangled in running powered equipment.” [18] The total number is likely much larger than 18,312 due to variables such as unreported injuries, but what is likely more accurate is machinery-related injuries make up approximately 21 percent of all severe injuries tracked. While, overall, severe injuries have slightly declined, machinery-related injury rates have remained stubbornly consistent, as shown in figure 6. The status quo will not solve this problem. Figure 6: Percentage of workplace injuries involving machinery [19] Other physical workplace risks do not materialize immediately. Repetitive strain from hand-intensive manufacturing processes or desk-bound work can lead to musculoskeletal disorders, eventually requiring rehabilitation surgeries. [20] Moreover, as a 2021 study shows, workers could face a variety of occupational risks ranging from exposure to allergens that could trigger pre-existing asthma to exposure to high UV that could cause eye injuries. [21] However, various types of workplace injuries are preventable when appropriate risk-mitigating measures are taken. Table 1 elaborates on a series of workplace risks and the interventions needed to prevent injuries. Table 1: Occupational risks in different work environments, workers at increased risk, and risk-mitigating interventions [22] Occupational risks Workers at increased risk Risk-mitigating interventions Asthma, COPD, respiratory infections, related diseases Workers with exposure to allergens and irritants Ventilation, pulmonary function testing, exposure monitoring, emission containment Behavioral, mental, or neurological disorders Workers in any work environment Identification of distress or mental illness; healthy work–life balance Cardiovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease, stroke Workers with exposure to lead, pollutants, or high stress environments Lead exposure monitoring and reduction; stress-reducing lifestyles Electrical hazard, electric shock, electrocution Electricians; workers in manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and power plants Ground-fault protection, electrical standards, hazard assessments, employee training, PPE Exertion, physical inactivity Workers in any work environment, particularly in offices and assembly plants Ergonomics, physical activity, lifestyle monitoring Eye injuries, cataract Outdoor workers, welders, carpenters; workers with high UV exposure Safety regulations, eye protection policies, eye wash stations, risk assessments, PPE Falls, slips, trips Workers in manufacturing, agriculture, construction, fishery, and mining Window guards, grab rails, lifelines, safety nets, lighting, equipment inspections, PPE Fire, heat, hot substances Firefighters, first responders; workers in mining, manufacturing, and construction Safety regulations, smoke detectors, fire suppression systems, evacuation plans, PPE Hearing loss Workers in mining, manufacturing, construction, and entertainment industry Limiting noise exposure, using noise-reducing controls, PPE Injuries from motor vehicles, mechanical forces, or road traffic Workers operating heavy machinery (e.g., in construction and industrial plants) Backup cameras, spotters, proximity detectors, driving laws, vehicle safety, drug testing Interpersonal violence Workers with frequent public interaction or handling cash Regulation, employee training, PPE Mesothelioma, melanoma, mouth or lung cancer Industrial, agricultural, and other workers exposed to carcinogens or radiation Exposure monitoring and reduction; capsulation and closed processes Musculoskeletal disorders Workers in agriculture, forestry, fishery, production, and service industry Ergonomics, specialized equipment and tools, adequate working hours, risk assessments Neonatal and congenital conditions Workers with exposure to certain chemicals and secondhand smoke Elimination of reproductive risks, engineering controls, no-smoke policies Repetitive motion with microtasks Workers in any work environment Ergonomics, regular breaks, monitoring of physical activity and lifestyle choices Skin diseases (e.g., contact dermatitis) Hairdressers, cosmetologists, cleaners, painters, health care workers Exposure monitoring; reduction of allergens or irritants; smoke-free policies, PPE Water-related incidents, drowning First responders; workers in boats, ships, ferries Safety rules, guard rails, evacuation plans While all jobs carry some risk, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that blue-collar workers likely face higher illness and injury rates than do white-collar peers. [23] Figure 7 shows that, in 2023, the top three industries with the highest share of workers with nonfatal injuries were manufacturing; trade, transportation, and utilities; and natural resources and mining. Figure 7: Share of U.S. workers with nonfatal illnesses and injuries by industry in 2023 [24] Similarly, the makeup of industries containing the highest share of workers with fatal illnesses and injuries further suggests that blue-collar workers face greater workplace risks. As figure 8 shows that, in 2023, natural resources and mining had a fatal injury rate of 0.03 percent, construction had a rate of 0.01 percent, and trade, transportation and utilities had a rate of 0.005 percent. Figure 8: Share of U.S. workers with fatal illnesses and injuries by industry, 2023 [25] Data-rich technologies integrated into clothing or machinery can detect hazards and anticipate risks before incidents occur. For example, embedded Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can alert workers if their limbs or clothing are close to a dangerous rotating band. [26] Depending on implementation, sensors could sound a preemptive warning or trigger a process slowdown. [27] These tools shift manufacturing safety from reactive compliance to proactive intervention. Wearable sensors and ergonomic algorithms can flag risky movements or overexertion before they lead to injury and recommend suggested breaks, workplace optimizations, or posture corrections. [28] For example, the National Safety Council (NSC), a nonprofit organization focused on eliminating the leading causes of preventable death and injury, has highlighted Amazon’s ErgoPick, an ergonomic picking assistance software, for helping reduce musculoskeletal disorders and back pain, as well as Pacific Gas & Electric Company’s Etiscope, for using wearable sensors to provide ergonomics risk assessments and real-time feedback for frontline and other industrial workers. [29] These individualized systems offer a major upgrade from traditional workplace safety interventions, generic safety protocols, and self-reported discomfort. [30] Furthermore, they can help reduce disability claims, absenteeism, and long-term health costs. [31] As a result, the United States could save billions each year. As NSC noted, the cost of workplace injuries and illnesses cost $176.5 billion in 2023. [32] Figure 9 shows a breakdown of workplace injury costs. Figure 9: Costs of workplace injuries, 2023 [33] Emerging workplace technologies can reduce cognitive strain and workplace stress. High-pressure professions such as nursing, trucking, and emergency response can particularly benefit from tools that monitor fatigue or optimize scheduling. [34] In hospitals, adaptive scheduling systems can reduce burnout by balancing workloads. [35] In logistics, fatigue-detection systems integrated into vehicle cabins have shown promise in reducing crash risk and occupational fatigue among long-haul truckers. [36] Biofeedback-enabled wearables can also offer workers real-time insight into physiological signals of stress, encouraging healthier self-regulation and flagging concerns to employers when appropriate. [37] With responsible implementation and clear boundaries for data use, these systems can deliver real mental health benefits. Critics have often pointed out that electronic and performance monitoring or always-on communication tools can give workers a sense of pressure or loss of autonomy. [38] These concerns are not unfounded, especially when combined with poor deployment, and deserve consideration. Yet, ignoring the potential mental health benefits of technology would also be shortsighted. As of now, the mental health upside is underexamined in federal discussions, such as in the 2024 GAO report. As policymakers consider how to regulate the use of workplace technology, understanding and encouraging its positive use cases should be part of the equation. Across industries, emerging workplace technologies are helping workers complete more complex or physically demanding work with greater speed and precision. As shown in figure 10, the few U.S. industries to achieve sustained labor productivity gains in recent years include oil and gas extraction, support activities for mining, and textile mills. These industries share the common feature of having adopted more automation, remote monitoring, and digital workflows. [39] Figure 10: Average annual change in productivity growth in manufacturing and mining industries, 2019–2023 [40] These innovations allow employers to produce more output with less manual effort. In oil and gas, for example, productivity rose 6.3 percent from 2019 to 2023, due in part to advanced drilling, predictive analytics, and remote operations centers. [41] Similarly, textile mills saw productivity increase by 2.4 percent thanks to robotics, smart looms, and automated quality control. [42] These cases show that when workplace technologies are thoughtfully deployed, they not only make work safer and less physically taxing—they also generate measurable economic value. Technology that augments physical labor is especially promising in industries where injuries and fatigue are common. Exoskeletons and wearable powered suits, for example, can reduce strain and increase endurance. In one retail pilot, grocery workers wearing back-support exosuits completed 8 percent more work per shift and reported 30 percent less back pain. [43] In warehouse settings, augmented-reality (AR) glasses and heads-up displays have boosted speed and accuracy by guiding workers step-by-step on tasks. [44] DHL Supply Chain reported a 25 percent faster picking process when warehouse staff used AR smart glasses. [45] In hazardous industries such as construction or manufacturing, these systems reduce mental and physical burden in repetitive or risky work. [46] Since the mainstream advent of generative AI models began in 2023, productivity gains have accelerated in many white-collar workplace settings. [47] AI tools have streamlined document review, code generation, and customer support workflows, allowing employees to offload routine tasks. However, as figure 10 shows, many U.S. industries saw negative productivity growth from 2019 to 2023, despite years of available workplace technology. These gaps are a result of uneven adoption. Industries such as manufacturing and mining often remain constrained by legacy infrastructure and face higher barriers to deploying new tools. [48] Closing this gap is not just about AI readiness, but also about investing in workplace-integrated systems that meet sector-specific needs. This is where targeted policy support can have an outsized impact. The concern that workplace technologies might intensify work pace rather than improve conditions also deserves consideration. Increasing worker productivity is a worthwhile goal, and higher productivity can lead to higher wages. However, critics accurately point out that efficiency gains can sometimes translate into unreasonably higher output expectations. [49] If employers use monitoring systems primarily to push workers beyond reasonable workloads, it may result in increased stress or job insecurity. But when the same technologies are deployed with the goals to identify and eliminate unnecessary strain, reduce errors, or provide better support, workers benefit alongside employers. Policymakers can set an example in this regard by tying workplace technology policy to safety and well-being goals in addition to productivity goals. Employers benefit from productivity-enhancing technologies through greater output per worker, fewer errors, and reduced injury-related disruptions. Yet, when implemented responsibly, these technologies also deliver meaningful value to workers. The most immediate impact comes from better on-the-job support. In physically demanding jobs, augmentation tools such as exoskeletons reduce strain, while wearable guidance systems reduce mental load by streamlining instructions. These tools do not eliminate hard work, but they can make it more tolerable and sustainable. In many settings, workplace technologies are less about transforming the job itself and more about reducing the friction of repetitive, stressful, or error-prone tasks. When algorithmic management systems are designed well, they can help automate monotonous workflows or optimize scheduling in ways that reduce unnecessary downtime and inefficiency. That may not shorten an eight-hour shift, but it can mean fewer avoidable mistakes, smoother collaboration, and less stress from chaotic or poorly coordinated processes. These are subtle but real quality-of-life improvements that matter, especially in physically demanding or high-pressure sectors where worker burnout and turnover are high. Workplace technology also has the potential to improve working conditions, offering greater flexibility and creating fairer performance systems. According to a 2023 Pew survey, 71 percent of remote-capable workers reported better work-life balance when able to work from home. [50] While not all jobs can be remote, flexible scheduling enabled by workforce management software can extend some of these benefits to frontline and shift-based workers. [51] Data-driven tools can also make performance evaluations more transparent and merit-based. When workers have visibility into the metrics that define success, and when those metrics are grounded in consistent, objective data, the result is greater trust. [52] Productivity trackers, personalized performance feedback systems, and skill development platforms can help workers understand expectations, track progress, and receive recognition for high performance. It is also important to recognize that expectations of privacy differ substantially between work and nonwork settings. Employees already work in environments where part of the job itself is managers continually observing and evaluating their performance. Using data to ensure that workers perform their duties effectively mirrors a supervisor physically observing them and—if designed and implemented well—makes the process more consistent, scalable, and evidence-based. Workplace technologies hold significant promise for expanding access to work, particularly for demographic groups historically marginalized in traditional labor markets. For older adults, people with disabilities, and workers with physical constraints, workplace technologies can enable workforce participation. As the U.S. workforce continues to age and labor force participation among people with disabilities remains disproportionately low, policymakers should see workplace technology as a lever for inclusion, not just a surveillance risk. [53] Wearables, sensors, and AI-driven interfaces can help more Americans work safely, effectively, and longer. For example, digital workflows can reduce the need for repetitive physical labor, and predictive scheduling systems or remote work infrastructure can accommodate medical or caregiving needs. [54] Research suggests that automation and assistive technologies have the potential to enable “longevity work” by aligning job design more closely with the needs of aging workers, especially if they are high-skilled. [55] Even for those who are not formally classified as disabled, robotic technologies can extend careers by offsetting physical decline and reducing injury risk. Exoskeletons are enabling assistive ambulation for patients who have undergone spinal cord injury and reducing strain on warehouse and construction industry workers’ backs and shoulders. [56] These technologies can delay retirement, lower turnover, and reduce the need for retraining, while making physically demanding jobs more humane. Workplace technology can act as a force multiplier for inclusion and expanding accessibility. But realizing these benefits will require policymakers to shift their focus beyond privacy and surveillance concerns alone to also consider workplace technology policy in conversation with economic participation and inclusive growth. This is an economic and social opportunity. Millions of working-age adults with disabilities remain unemployed or underemployed despite being willing and able to work. [57] According to the Department of Labor (DOL), 4 in 10 adults with disabilities ages 16 to 64 were either working or actively looking for work in 2024. [58] Yet, people with disabilities face challenges finding work. Despite the 2024 unemployment rate in the United States being at about 4 percent, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities was about 8.1 percent for those ages 16 to 64, signaling that people with disabilities want to work but have a harder time finding a job partly because they face more workplace challenges. [59] However, with the right policy support, workplace technologies could narrow this gap. Emerging workplace technologies do not only collect large volumes of data about workers but also new types of data that can reveal previously private aspects of the human experience, such as a worker’s level of fatigue. As data-rich technologies come into use across workplaces, policymakers should clearly understand what data these systems collect so that they can create effective regulation. Biometric data includes physiological signals such as heart rate, body temperature, respiratory function, blood glucose levels, and hydration. [60] These data types are foundational to applications in real-time health monitoring, early illness detection, and fatigue risk management, and are collected in physically demanding or high-risk occupations such as logistics, utilities, and construction. [61] Ergonomic wearables, vision systems, and connected tools capture movement and postural data. These data streams reflect how workers move, analyzing their lifting angles, joint strain, repetitive motion patterns, and overall muscular exertion. [62] Cognitive and mental state data offers insight into workload strain, emotional regulation, and mental acuity. These data types are often more sensitive but offer potential applications in preventing burnout or cognitive overload in fields such as air traffic control and technical operations. [63] Behavioral and productivity data such as system usage patterns, workflow traces, and digital engagement metrics can help optimize processes, identify friction points, and personalize task support through AI software platforms. [64] Environmental exposure data, captured via workplace infrastructure sensors, tracks air quality, temperature, noise, and exposure to harmful substances. [65] Real-time physical location and proximity data track workers’ positions within a facility or site, often using GPS, RFID, or Bluetooth sensors. [66] These data streams can enhance safety by ensuring that employees remain in safe zones, avoid workplace violence, and manage equipment usage in shared spaces. [67] Not all workplace data is equally sensitive, and different types of data carry different potential for misuse or benefit. Biometric and mental state data, for example, can reveal highly sensitive personal information and may demand stronger protection. Ergonomic and environmental data, such as movement patterns or air quality, can be relatively lower-risk and offer clear benefits in driving down workplace injuries or fatigue. Employers collect workplace data through both passive and active mechanisms. Passive collection involves background monitoring that requires no worker input, such as wearable sensors tracking posture and ambient cameras scanning for safety hazards. [68] Active collection relies on worker interaction, such as completing self-reports or logging task progress. [69] Many emerging systems use a hybrid model, combining passive sensor data with active inputs to refine accuracy. [70] Understanding these distinctions is important when evaluating systems for fairness and psychological impact. For instance, a wearable that quietly monitors hydration levels in warehouse workers and only issues alerts when thresholds are breached would likely make for a helpful safety tool, whereas a system that flags every missed keystroke in a software developer’s code could quickly become counterproductive. No two workplaces are the same. Employers implement workplace technology differently across different workplaces, such as a factory versus a long-haul truck. The same is true for different job types. For example, employees may adopt and perceive workplace technologies differently depending on whether their roles are unionized, contracted, or salaried. Layered atop these distinctions are sectoral factors such as regulatory intensity, safety risks, and performance measurement norms. One example is that an AI camera in a meatpacking plant may primarily prevent injuries, whereas the same technology in a customer service environment may focus more on workflow efficiency and error reduction. As a result, a one-workplace-fits-all policy approach to workplace technology is likely to miss critical nuances. The distribution of labor and capital to the workplace is also important. In labor-intensive workplaces, such as a factory with workers picking items off an assembly line, technologies are often deployed to better standardize worker output and lower skill requirements. [71] On the other hand, in more capital-intensive work environments, such as a factory with robots already performing tasks and workers in more skilled roles that work to manage the robots, workplace technologies are generally more used to increase workers’ flexibility and already-high levels of skills. [72] Given this complexity across workplaces, policymakers should think strategically about which types of work environments stand to benefit the most from thoughtful technological integration, and where policy intervention is most needed to support both innovation and worker well-being. Despite the real promises that workplace technologies offer, public and policy discourse remains focused on two concerns: job automation and worker surveillance. Job loss due to automation is frequently cited but ultimately overstated. [73] A large body of economic research shows that technological adoption tends to shift labor demand rather than eliminate it outright. [74] New roles are created even as others change or disappear, and workers, including those in lower-skilled jobs, generally benefit over time through increased productivity, wages, and workplace safety. [75] Given the depth of existing work on automation, this report focuses on the second, and less debated, policy concern: surveillance. The problem is not surveillance itself, but rather how the term is used. Describing any data-collecting workplace technology as “surveillance” muddles the distinctions between technologies, data types, and workplaces in question. A more appropriate framework would recognize the current moment as a continuation of the digital transformation of the workplace. One example would be the shift of the 1990s and 2000s, when email, enterprise software, and Internet connectivity redefined white- and blue-collar work alike. [76] Emerging tools such as wearables, edge computing, AI, and connected sensors are likewise not inherently dystopian. Some monitoring tools serve clear public interest functions in the workplace. Real-time telemetry in warehouse forklifts prevents collisions. [77] Heat stress sensors can trigger alerts before a worker suffers from heatstroke. These are examples of safety technologies. [78] Collapsing them into a general fear of monitoring obscures their benefits and may disincentivize adoption. That said, even the most well-intentioned uses of workplace technology raise legitimate questions about privacy, transparency, and governance. However, the role of government is not to police bad management or enforce corporate best practices. Instead, wherever data collection enables monitoring that is hidden, excessive, not justified by or clearly misaligned with worker benefits, policymakers have a role to play. It is important to acknowledge that many workplace technologies are still maturing. Issues such as poor sensor calibration, false positives, and unreliable data quality remain widespread in many real-world work environments. [79] Consider a long-distance driver evaluated by an app that monitors speed, braking patterns, and rest periods. If the driver slams on the brakes to avoid a deer that jumps into the path of the truck, their safety score may drop. In this case, the problem is not that the employer records the data. Instead, this case raises two separate problems. First is the technological need for workplace technologies to evolve from static tools into adaptive systems that better incorporate human judgment and contextual awareness. False positives where legitimate or even exemplary behavior is unfairly penalized show how poorly designed workplace technologies, especially those based on narrow rules, can misunderstand signals. Second, even when data is accurate and includes the necessary context, how employers use that data may be flawed or unfair. Policymakers should recognize both of these potential gaps: technological and governance. Well-designed future systems will better incorporate environmental and other types of data to contextualize behavior. But until systems can reliably do that, workers should ideally have clear processes to challenge or explain flagged incidents, particularly when these flags affect job security or pay. Due process should not be an afterthought in digital workplaces. Policymakers have a role to play here. Government research funding and procurement requirements can encourage user-centered design principles, ensuring that systems do not just optimize for managerial oversight but also serve workers. Public-sector leadership could help reorient the market toward systems that balance performance tracking with fairness and reliability. As discussed ahead, recent legislative efforts to regulate workplace technology reflect growing anxiety about surveillance and algorithmic management. While some of these concerns are real, many proposed laws risk overcorrecting without accounting for the potential benefits for workers. In other areas of regulation, the government has an important role in funding independent technical validation of algorithmic tools used in employment, much like the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates medical devices. [80] A similar model could help inform oversight of high-impact algorithmic tools in employment. Today, most audits and impact assessments are employer funded and lack consistent standards. [81] Government-backed technical validation for workplace technology used in high-stakes contexts such as hiring and disciplinary decisions could promote trust without requiring new and rigid mandates. This would also help distinguish those tools against low-risk applications such as automated interview scheduling, allowing regulations to focus oversight on the former without burdening the latter. On the other hand, policymakers should avoid intervening where market incentives already discourage bad behavior. For example, proposals discussed ahead would prohibit the use of basic productivity tracking tools such as keystroke monitors. [82] While some employers certainly misapply these tools, more employers already avoid overuse because doing so undermines morale, creates retention issues, and leads to costly reputational backlash. [83] Legislative and regulatory pressures are not the only forces that can slow workplace technology adoption. Third parties, including labor organizations, can also shape technology deployment in deleterious ways. For example, certain union contracts, such as provisions negotiated by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters with United Postal Service, give unions the right to review any new technological solutions before implementation. [84] Similarly, longshore unions have actively opposed the introduction of automation at U.S. ports. [85] Any comprehensive policy framework should therefore account for the influence of these third parties, balancing worker protections with the need to deploy technology that improves safety, productivity, and overall job quality. Most legislative proposals lack a forward-looking perspective on how digital tools can benefit workers. Besides OSHA requirements, no laws affirmatively encourage the use of data for injury prevention, hazard detection, or improved work conditions. [86] Instead of default prohibitions, lawmakers should design “safe harbor” provisions that enable experimentation with workplace technologies, provided they meet baseline fairness, transparency, and safety standards. This would encourage employers to adopt beneficial innovations while providing workers with clear protection. Recent state-level legislative proposals aimed at workplace technology reflect a growing discomfort with employer technology use, regardless of context. For example, California’s 2022 Workplace Technology Accountability Act would have required employers to conduct detailed algorithmic impact assessments covering virtually every use of employee data, regardless of context or risk. [87] It defined “electronic monitoring” so broadly that it could include innocuous systems such as badge swipes or logistics software. More recent bills such as “SB-7 Employment: automated decision systems” and “AB 1331 Workplace surveillance” in California also continue this trend. [88] For example, AB 1331 threatens the use of badge data for performance coaching or operational insights by imposing broad restrictions on “off-duty” data, which could include routine interactions on-site, such as scanning a badge for access to amenities. Similarly, New York’s 2024 proposed Bossware and Oppressive Technologies Act would have banned employers from using algorithmic systems as the “primary basis” for employment decisions. [89] That would not distinguish between opaque surveillance and tools designed to reduce bias or support safety. While these bills are framed as protective, they reflect a deeper mistrust of workplace technology itself, often defaulting to assuming that all data collection is suspect, even when that data could be used to proactively prevent accidents or monitor fatigue. Illinois’s Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) attempts to regulate biometric data such as fingerprints and facial scans. [90] On its face, BIPA appears well-intentioned: it requires employers to get consent before collecting such data and mandates that it be stored securely. However, in practice, BIPA has become a cautionary tale in how privacy laws can go wrong. Following a 2019 Illinois Supreme Court ruling that allowed individuals to sue even without showing harm, BIPA triggered a surge of lawsuits. [91] Class actions have ballooned into high-cost settlements, often with the payouts going to attorneys rather than affected individuals. This litigation wave has chilled legitimate technology use in Illinois workplaces and discouraged small businesses from adopting timekeeping and access systems that rely on biometrics, which prevents fraudulent time tracking (e.g., buddy punching, where one employee clocks in or out for another) and creates more convenience for employees, who do not have to remember passwords. The result is a law with flawed incentives. The lesson from BIPA and more sweeping proposals in California and New York is that poorly scoped privacy regulation can make it harder, not easier, to protect workers. To move forward, state lawmakers should prioritize filling narrow policy gaps that require government intervention but are too niche to make legislative progress at the federal level. At the federal level, proposed legislative efforts reflect legitimate concerns about privacy and digital oversight, but suffer from the flaw of framing workplace technology as invasive surveillance. Bills such as the Stop Spying Bosses Act and the No Robot Bosses Act, both introduced over the last two years by Representatives Chris Deluzio (D-PA) and Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR) in the House and former Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) in the Senate, aim to restrict or mandate disclosures around data use but fail to distinguish between surveillance that is punitive and opaque versus monitoring that is aimed at positive goals such as injury prevention and fatigue management. [92] There are already some important protections already in place. Federal antidiscrimination laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibit employment practices that have disparate impact or unfairly target protected groups. [93] This means that if a workplace algorithm, for example, uses biometric or behavioral data in a way that disproportionately disadvantages people of color or people with disabilities, employers could be vulnerable to litigation. Similarly, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) protects workers’ rights to organize and prohibits employer actions that interfere with collective activity. [94] Putting checks on the primary use of algorithmic systems in hiring or performance reviews can make sense in high-risk contexts, but applied too broadly, these rules could prevent employers from using even well-validated models to identify skill gaps or reward high-performing employees. For example, technology such as Canditech’s platform and others that help assess skills and reduce subjectivity in hiring could be implicated. [95] Moreover, these bills risk promoting human discretion as a gold standard, despite ample evidence that human managers are themselves prone to bias, inconsistency, and opacity. [96] What is missing in the federal legislative landscape is how data-rich technologies could affirmatively improve worker outcomes. The government is doing too little to seed public-private partnerships that could demonstrate how data-rich workplaces can yield measurable improvements in health, safety, and worker convenience. At the same time, there are areas where the federal government should tread carefully or stay out altogether. Federal intervention should not substitute for internal corporate governance, private sector codes of conduct, or collective bargaining agreements that reflect the specific needs of different workplaces. Ultimately, the federal role should not be to ban or bureaucratize workplace technology, but rather to set a floor by creating guardrails and incentives for it to be used responsibly. This includes ensuring that workers have agency and voice in how technologies are deployed, companies are rewarded for responsible data use, and the technologies with the greatest potential to reduce injuries, burnout, and inequality are scaled. OSHA plays a critical role in setting binding workplace safety standards. [97] These rules carry legal force, and noncompliance can result in fines, mandatory remediation, or criminal penalties. OSHA standards shape employer behavior, define what is safe, and set the floor for industry practices. But OSHA’s authority is constrained by scope and speed. Because its standards must be evidence-based and undergo a rulemaking process, they often lag behind the fast rate of developments in workplace technology. [98] For example, OSHA’s standards cover personal protective equipment, ventilation, and exposure to harmful substances, but offer little guidance on technologies already reshaping modern workplaces, such as sensor-based monitoring systems, wearables, biometric fatigue detection, and AI-driven safety analytics. [99] In construction, OSHA’s standard for “General Safety and Health Provisions” requires training and hazard mitigation but does not mention real-time sensing or AI tools already being deployed on worksites. [100] Similarly, standards for noise exposure and radiation omit provisions for using wearable tech to detect and log these exposures continuously. This regulatory lag creates a two-tier system. Forward-looking companies that want to modernize may find little regulatory guidance, while laggards face no pressure to modernize beyond legacy methods. Startups and researchers developing category-creating workplace technologies face a dilemma: the lack of prescriptive standards offers theoretical freedom but in practice deters investment and slows the commercialization cycle. While OSHA governs workplace safety, it does not cover how safety technologies are designed. In this vacuum, voluntary standards bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and ASTM International have developed voluntary technical standards for the design of physical systems such as wearable robotics and safety equipment. [101] However, their reach is limited and mismatched with the needs of real-world workers. ISO 13482, for instance, addresses safety for personal care robots and was never intended for heavy-duty industrial use. [102] Likewise, ASTM’s F48 committee on exosuits is one of the few efforts tailored to labor settings, but its influence remains limited by slow adoption and voluntary uptake. [103] Meanwhile, the U.S. government has failed to fully use its considerable leverage as a funder and buyer to shape the development of these technologies. Federal agencies that fund R&D have long supported exoskeletons and human augmentation in military and health contexts but have rarely aligned their investments toward labor market needs or workplace applications. [104] Workplace technologies are evolving rapidly, but policy discussions too often frame them narrowly as surveillance tools rather than recognizing their potential to improve safety, health, and productivity. To shift this conversation and ensure a balanced approach, policymakers at all levels should focus on clarifying lawful uses of workplace data, incentivizing responsible innovation, and embedding worker voices in technology deployment. Increasing both the R&D of workplace technologies and their responsible adoption across the U.S. economy is critical to unlocking the technology’s upside at scale. The following recommendations outline steps federal, state, and local governments can take to establish guardrails, accelerate adoption of beneficial tools, and build trust in data-rich workplaces. Congress should task DOL, in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission and other relevant agencies, to develop a federal workplace technology framework that complements broader privacy legislation while addressing the unique dynamics of the employer-employee relationship. This framework should focus on clarifying for employers any nonpermissible uses of workplace data under existing law and recommended best practices for lawful uses, explaining to employees their rights and expectations, and advising Congress to focus on clarifying lawful uses of workplace data so that employers can deploy workplace technologies to serve legitimate operational needs while preventing generalized surveillance. This framework should clearly distinguish between employer-deployed technologies and personal consumer devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, to avoid regulatory overreach while maintaining focus on workplace-specific data flows. As a forward-looking structure, this policy should align with any future federal privacy legislation, ensuring consistency while preserving the distinct considerations of the workplace context. The framework should also codify clear definitions for data collection, electronic monitoring, and surveillance. Crucially, the framework should be shaped through a transparent, consultative process that ideally would include input from a broad range of stakeholders, including workers and worker advocacy groups. DOL can play a key role by creating structured opportunities—such as public comment periods, listening sessions, and targeted outreach to underrepresented sectors—for workers to share their perspectives on how technologies affect safety, autonomy, and job quality. To complement a federal workplace technology framework, the federal government should expand R&D efforts for workplace technology. DOL, working in partnership with the National Science Foundation (NSF), should create a dedicated fund for rigorous field-testing and pilot programs focused on technologies that improve job quality, safety, and accessibility. These tools should be platform agnostic to ensure broad usability across devices and environments. Simultaneously, the U.S. Census Bureau should expand its Annual Business Survey to gather more precise data on where and how workplace technologies are being deployed across industries and firm sizes. This data is essential to shaping targeted, evidence-based policy interventions and avoiding overgeneralizations based on high-profile companies alone. The federal government should also utilize its role as the nation’s largest employer and buyer to accelerate responsible workplace technology adoption. Through executive action, the White House should direct agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management, Department of Defense, and Department of Health and Human Services to pilot safety-enhancing and productivity-boosting technologies in public-sector workplaces. Procurement should be coupled with open reporting on worker outcomes and post-deployment evaluation to ensure that technology adoption produces measurable benefits without introducing unintended risks. Policymakers should modernize workplace safety standards to foster innovation without compromising worker protection. Rather than mandating specific tools, OSHA should adopt flexible, outcome-based standards that define what workplace technologies must achieve while allowing companies to choose how to meet those goals. These standards should include basic worker protections such as transparency, data security, and anonymization provisions where feasible. Tiered frameworks that reward voluntary, tech-enhanced safety programs can further incentivize adoption, following the successful model of OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Programs. To complement this, the federal government should establish a cross-agency initiative led by OSHA in partnership with NIST and NSF to develop integrated design standards into the R&D incentives for workplace technologies. By coordinating standards and investment strategies across agencies, the United States can reduce regulatory ambiguity and create a foundation for workplace technology design standards. Ultimately, the U.S. government should update standards for workplace technology through the use of federal procurement and grant-making to incentivize responsible design. Voluntary standards, while helpful, are not enough on their own. Without relevance to real-world labor conditions, these standards risk becoming a checklist for compliance rather than a foundation for safer and better-performing workplace technology. GAO has stated that its 2024 report will be followed by another report that “will incorporate stakeholder interviews and a literature search to enhance the information related the uses and impacts of digital surveillance. Additionally, it will address how federal agencies oversee employers’ use of digital surveillance technology.” [105] The follow-up GAO report should explicitly examine not only potential risks but also the benefits and positive impacts of digital monitoring and other next-generation workplace technologies. Accountability should include not only identifying harms but also assessing whether federal agencies are effectively using advanced data-driven tools to improve worker safety, health, productivity, and inclusion across the federal workforce. By evaluating both risks and benefits, GAO can provide a more balanced perspective that informs policymakers on how to maximize the potential of workplace technologies for employees throughout government operations. The federal government has a role to play in reshaping public conversation around workplace technology. To counter simplistic narratives equating all monitoring with harmful surveillance, DOL and OSTP should publish clear guidance that distinguishes protective technologies from invasive ones. A roundtable comprising technologists, labor representatives, and employers should develop shared norms and model language for the responsible use of workplace data. Policymakers from agencies such as DOL and OSTP should issue clear public guidance that reframes data-driven workplace technologies as potential tools for safety, equity, and productivity and not inherently surveillance tools. To further promote responsible technology use without deterring adoption, DOL should establish a Workplace Technology Accountability Bureau (WTAB) that acts as a nonregulatory, independent office modeled on the Better Business Bureau. This entity would serve as a trusted, centralized hub where workers, unions, and whistleblowers could anonymously report concerns about misuse of workplace technologies. Rather than enforcing penalties, the WTAB would focus on transparency and public trust by investigating complaints, surfacing best practices, and issuing voluntary trust grades for companies based on their adherence to principles such as transparency, data minimization, and worker engagement. Importantly, these evaluations would distinguish between beneficial, safety-enhancing tools and systems that raise legitimate concerns around privacy. Congress should direct the U.S. Census Bureau, in coordination with DOL and NIST, to collect more detailed, sector-specific data on the adoption of next-generation workplace technologies in the private sector. Surveys should capture information on technology type, purpose, scale of deployment, and workforce demographics across diverse labor arrangements. Integrating this data with existing BLS, OSHA, and Census datasets would allow for more evidence-based analysis of how these technologies affect worker safety, productivity, and inclusion. Regular collection and public reporting of these findings would provide policymakers and researchers with the insights needed to design targeted incentives, R&D programs, and technical assistance, while ensuring federal policy is informed by the actual use and impact of workplace technologies. State and local governments should focus on narrowly tailored policies that address clear gaps or high-risk uses of workplace technology, rather than broad prohibitions such as California’s 2022 Workplace Technology Accountability Act. Legislation should distinguish between protective and safety- or convenience-enhancing workplace data collection or technologies on one hand and intrusive surveillance on the other. State and local policymakers could, for example, require reporting or impact assessments only for technologies used in high-risk or high-stakes contexts, while providing incentives to adopt tools that demonstrably improve safety, reduce injury, and support inclusion. By adopting a context-sensitive approach, state and local governments can protect workers without discouraging adoption of technologies that deliver measurable benefits. Once again, imagine a hospital in the near future—but in a world wherein the U.S. government has failed to act. The technology for automated systems that can alert emergency room staff about incoming patients’ ailments exists but has not been adopted by the hospital because no incentives existed to develop or validate it. Staff have wearable health monitors, but instead of preventing fatigue, they are used to pressure staff into skipping breaks in an absence of legal red lines. The technologies that could help reduce worker injury and burnout exist, but without policy guardrails or public investment, they are either missing or misused. This is the future the United States risks: one in which innovation still happens, but its benefits bypass the very workers it was meant to support because policymakers have demonized the technology and waited too long to support it.

What Happened to the American Business Creed? Part II: Societal Attacks Materialism and Productivity Practical Realism The Continuing Goal of Progress The Need for Optimism and the Spirit of Adventure Restoring the Culture of Growth,2025-10-17,Robert D. Atkinson,"In August, I wrote about a 1956 book, The American Business Creed , and how that creed played a central role in building America into the strongest economy in the world. A reader asked if I would speculate on why what was generally accepted in the 1950s is now largely ignored—or even demonized. A few weeks ago , I focused on how changes within the business community itself eroded certain principles. In this follow-on post, I turn to the broader social forces that have launched a wide-scale attack on other values. Let me reiterate the book’s seven key U.S. business values: Individualism with moral responsibility and freedom Materialism and productivity Practical realism The continuing goal of progress The need for optimism and the spirit of adventure Democracy and universalism Service and social responsibility One can make a strong case that these principles—held by American businesses and supported by most of U.S. society, including all but the most left-wing elites—were central to establishing and sustaining U.S. global economic leadership. In Part I, I discussed how business-led changes have eroded, but by no means completely, two specific principles: democracy and universalism, and service and social responsibility. Here, I examine how societal shifts have undermined and accelerated the erosion of four other principles: Materialism and productivity Practical realism The continuing goal of progress The need for optimism and the spirit of adventure These four business principles once reflected the optimism and pragmatism that fueled American growth. Today, each is severely weakened, facing mounting social skepticism and cultural opposition. The creed affirms that “material advantages are an essential part of the good society,” but it explicitly rejects “sybaritic enjoyment of wealth.” Music to my ears. Boosting living standards depends on valuing both materialism and productivity. But over the last half century, each has come under sustained attack. We now live in a world where materialism is portrayed as killing the planet and productivity as killing jobs, while many claim that too many people make too much money. As I wrote in “The Abandonment of Productivity and the Decline of the West,” Thankfully, most businesses still hold strongly to the value of materialism and productivity. But achieving those goals is difficult when broader culture and policy push back. Those experiencing scarcity—or who can still remember “want”—tend to find prioritizing growth less challenging. But as more people move into the middle class and those memories fade, it becomes easier to take prosperity for granted. In many cases, complacency, or even outright derision toward growth, takes root. However, given the vast benefits of economic growth to society—higher incomes across all classes, more tax revenue for public goods, and greater national power—America cannot afford the luxury of deprioritizing growth, at least not without suffering serious consequences. The creed hit the nail on the head by warning that “we disregard the basic laws of human nature at our peril.” Yet that principle, too, is now routinely attacked. We need look no further than the growing attraction to universal basic income, which ignores the simple reality that many people will choose not to work if they do not have to. The same applies to the increasing popularity of socialism, particularly among younger Americans, which similarly discounts human nature. A healthy society must ground its ideals in realism, not wishful thinking, if it expects progress to last. The creed champions a constant dissatisfaction with the existing state of affairs, indicating that America should be in a “continuous revolution” of technical and material advancement. While I could not agree more, that value is also under societal siege today. Technological advancement, once a source of national pride, is now routinely portrayed in dystopian terms—stealing privacy, killing jobs, destroying the environment, and undermining democracy. We see this in the widespread demonization of Marc Andreessen’s “ Techno-Optimist Manifesto ,” which The Washington Post dismissed as a “self-serving cry for help.” Half a century ago, a statement such as “Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential” would have been widely accepted across both political parties. Today, elite opinion too often mocks such optimism as egotistical or naïve. When progress becomes suspect, decline is not far behind. “The business[person] or the citizen who finds a new and effective way of doing things is a hero,” rightly states the 1950s creed. But in 2025, the need for optimism and the spirit of adventure have also eroded. Technological disruption is now treated as something to fear or regulate away. Case in point: Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater dismissed the importance of creative destruction, stating , “Economists call this creative destruction and shrug it off as merely market forces at play. But neoliberal public policy also played a role in enabling this creative destruction, and not always for the better.” When a society prizes stasis and comfort over adventure and risk, stagnation—and ultimately decline—inevitably follow. This year’s Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences recognizes Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt—Mokyr for identifying how technology and invention sustain long-run economic growth and Aghion and Howitt for developing the creative destruction model, which shows how loss and renewal through innovation drive productivity and living standards. Their work on innovation-driven growth is a timely reminder of what many Americans seem to have forgotten: prosperity depends on valuing productivity, grounding ideals in realism, striving continually for progress, and maintaining the optimism and adventurous spirit to embrace change rather than fear it. While it is beyond the scope of this series to discuss whether it is possible to reinstate the business values and societal support that characterized the 1950s, one thing is clear: The business creed of that era helped make the United States the strongest economy in the world. If America is to avoid further decline in global techno-economic competitiveness, innovation, and productivity growth, especially relative to China, it must restore a culture that values, rather than demonizes, growth and creative destruction. Rebuilding this ethos requires more than changes within business; it demands a broader societal commitment to progress, realism, and ambition. Yet given the powerful cultural forces arrayed against these ideals—certainly on the progressive left, but increasingly within the new right as well—this will not be easy. Defenders of progress must once again step up to the battle lines and fight.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/17/what-happened-to-the-american-business-creed-part-ii-societal-attacks/
The Brussels Effect Comes to Brasília: Why Its New Digital Markets Bill Misses the Mark,2025-10-17,Lilla Nóra Kiss,"Brazil’s new Digital Markets Bill (Bill No. 4.675/2025) would amend the country’s 2011 Competition Law to create a parallel antitrust regulatory framework for digital platforms, empowering the nation’s competition authority, the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), to exercise broad, discretionary oversight of markets already governed by existing competition law. Specifically, the Bill would entitle CADE to impose new ex ante obligations that proactively regulate conduct before it occurs. However, this new digital competition regime is a mistake: Brazil’s digital markets show no evidence of market failure in the form of persistent deficiencies in competition or consumer harm that cannot be corrected through existing law enforcement tools. By seeking to regulate non-existent problems, the Bill attempts to create a complex regime that addresses hypothetical risks at the expense of innovation and legal certainty. CADE’s new Superintendence of Digital Markets (SMD) would monitor digital platforms, label certain companies as “economic agents of systemic relevance in digital markets” (SREAs), and impose special obligations on them. A firm becomes subject to the regime only after a formal designation process, which the SMD may initiate on its own or in response to a substantiated complaint from another company, regulator, or public body. Once designated, the status applies to the entire corporate group, even if its activities or technologies change. The designation lasts ten years and contains no mechanism for early review or termination. The Bill also grants the SMD broad investigative powers, including the ability to demand data, hold public hearings, and recommend fines of up to 20 percent of a company’s turnover for noncompliance. The Bill sets both quantitative and qualitative criteria to determine whether a firm is designated as an SREA. Quantitatively, a firm must first exceed R$ 50 billion in global annual revenue (around US$ 9 billion) or R$ 5 billion in domestic revenue (around US$ 900 million). Qualitatively, a firm must also display at least one “systemic” trait, such as strong network effects, vertical integration, control of large datasets, a strategic intermediation role, or a large multi-sided user base. Although the Ministry of Finance estimates only five to ten firms will qualify, the broad qualitative criteria could expand the Bill’s scope and potentially capture dozens of firms. Once designated, companies would face a wide array of special obligations. These include restrictions on self-preferencing—for instance, giving their own services greater visibility in search or app rankings—and even limits on multi-homing, which allows business users or consumers to offer or access products across multiple platforms. Other prohibited practices cover a platform’s use of business-user data to enhance its own services, tying or bundling different products, and restricting interoperability with third-party systems. Additional positive duties require firms to disclose ranking and pricing criteria, ensure data portability, and provide interoperability interfaces. Formally, these obligations appear per se and are listed as automatic prohibitions. Yet the Bill appears to allow some opportunities for pro-competitive justification and information security exceptions at CADE’s discretion. The Bill rests on a weak foundation. Brazil shows no clear signs of market failure in its digital sectors, and existing competition law already provides effective tools for addressing misconduct. CADE has demonstrated its ability to handle complex digital antitrust cases—such as bringing enforcement actions against global firms like Apple and Google under the current framework—confirming that ex post enforcement can handle alleged abuses without new regulation. Moreover, even if Brazil found that its existing competition tools were inadequate to handle digital market failure, it would be more prudent to strengthen or refine the current regime with more modest ex post oriented reforms rather than introduce a new system that preemptively polices potential harms. At bottom, the Bill borrows heavily from foreign models like the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the UK’s Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act—rather than focusing on what Brazil’s digital economy actually needs. The Bill also prohibits conduct that is often pro-competitive rather than harmful. Practices such as self-preferencing, bundling, and data integration typically enhance efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and/or improve user experience. By banning these outright, the Bill risks stifling the very competition it seeks to protect. Evidence from the EU’s DMA already demonstrates the risks of per se rules: Google’s forced separation of search and maps has degraded the user experience and hurt small businesses that rely on visibility, while Apple delayed rolling out new features, such as Apple Intelligence and Live Translation for AirPods, due to interoperability mandates. Additionally, the Bill’s ten-year designation period introduces another layer of rigidity. In markets that evolve within months, this long duration could lock companies into outdated obligations, even as competition or technology shifts. The absence of a review mechanism further compounds the problem, leaving Brazil’s digital sector governed by static designations in a dynamic economy. Moreover, the designation applies to the entire corporate group rather than to a specific core-platform service, such as e-commerce or social networking—an excessive approach that could cause friction in otherwise highly competitive and dynamic markets. Finally, the Bill risks creating diplomatic and economic frictions between the United States and Brazil by disproportionately targeting American technology firms. As noted above, the Ministry of Finance estimates that the Bill may focus on five to ten top tech firms, suggesting that Brazil may follow the EU, which has already drawn criticism from Washington for targeting U.S. platforms using the DMA. Doing so would likely draw the ire of the Trump administration, which has made clear that it will defend U.S. digital industries from discriminatory foreign regulations through trade or other retaliatory measures. As such, instead of strengthening the Brazil-U.S. strategic partnership, the Bill could strain bilateral relations at a moment when cooperation on digital policy and innovation would be far more productive. Brazil should avoid falling into the “Brussels Effect” trap by uncritically following Europe’s lead in digital regulation. Its competition framework already functions effectively, empowering CADE to address abuses as they arise. Rather than replicating Europe’s rigid, one-size-fits-all model, Brazil should uphold its evidence-based, case-by-case approach.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/17/the-brussels-effect-comes-to-brasilia-why-its-new-digital-markets-bill-misses-the-mark/
"Nature Conservation, Dire Wolves, Moratoria, and Technophobia",2025-10-14,L. Val Giddings,"“In considering the risks of recombinant DNA, we shy at kittens and cuddle tigers.” Thus James Watson, co-discoverer with Francis Crick of the structure of DNA in 1953 —thanks to data developed by Rosalind Franklin — distilled the import of an earlier (now almost ancient) episode of alarms over what could go wrong once humans start messing with nature. The Washington Post documents why Watson’s trenchant observation remains relevant today, reporting that “The International Union for Conservation of Nature [IUCN], a top conservation group, is weighing a moratorium on unleashing genetically modified plants or animals into the wild” because “the consequences of any misstep, they say, may be uncontainable and irreversible.” The marquee trigger for these concerns is, ostensibly, worries about dire wolves , or rather their genetic relatives . But this isn’t really about dire wolves or anything adjacent. It’s mostly about misplaced technophobia. Does anything in the past half century suggest these fears are well grounded, and that the proposed moratorium would do more good than harm? In a word, no. IUCN is an important and highly regarded group with a sad task: cataloguing the world’s threatened biodiversity. There is a vast literature on biodiversity and the causes of its loss: at the top of every list is the loss of wild lands, primarily by conversion to agriculture, but also to other forms of development. This is followed by overfishing, wildlife poaching, invasive species, and climate change. Should IUCN risk its prestige to a proposed moratorium on introducing genetically modified plants or animals? The case is dubious. Genetically engineered plants have now been grown for decades on hundreds of millions of acres by millions upon millions of farmers. The result has been considerable reductions in pesticide usage, topsoil erosion, CO 2 emissions, and biodiverse habitat lost from wildlands to agriculture, and despite billions upon billions of meals consumed by humans and livestock not a single confirmed case of so much as a sniffle. Thanks to the increased yields they deliver, reducing the need to convert wild lands to agriculture, genetically engineered plants, it is clear, have been a major benefactor of biodiversity. If similar calls for a moratorium on the ‘deliberate release’ of genetically engineered plants had been heeded in the late 20 th century, all those gains, worth billions upon billions to farmers, consumers, and the environment would have been lost with no remotely counterbalancing benefits. But let us focus on genetically modified animals, whether they’re part of Colossal’s de-extinction push or other efforts aimed at restoration of threatened populations, alleviating health threats, improved food production, addressing climate change, and so forth. The number of different genetically engineered animals in play is not large: those most widely known include the previously mentioned dire wolves (and not so far along, thylacines and woolly mammoths), black-footed ferrets , and mosquitoes . With respect to dire wolves, mammoths, thylacines, and other similarly charismatic Pleistocene denizens, even if the scientists working to de-extinct them succeed (and despite being some of the best in the world , they face considerable technical challenges) the question remains: where would they put them? I would welcome dire wolves in my neighborhood (we have a superabundance of white-tailed deer, for which the main control measure seems to be inefficient and expensive predation by automobile) but I am probably an outlier. But their habitats are gone—they went extinct for a reason. And though efforts are underway to restore some of those habitats, these also face monumental challenges that are not assured of success. It is hard to imagine a future world in which any significant number of these large mammals would be free roaming over the landscape except in rare and unusual locations and circumstances, and none that would tip scales on a global basis. It is fair, though, to wonder if the money spent on such de-extinction efforts might not generate greater returns if invested in more classical conservation efforts, like habitat conservation or improving agricultural production. But inasmuch as most de-extinction R&D is being pursued with private funds, this may be more a question for venture capitalists to consider than government regulators or biodiversity managers. The black-footed ferret presents a very different case. This is not a matter of de-extinction but of “genetic rescue.” Mustela nigripes was thought to be extinct not once, but twice , with its most recent re-discovery in 1981 in rural Wyoming. The rediscovered population, however, consisted of only seven reproductive individuals, in a population with a striking lack of genetic diversity. But using tissue preserved from a ferret that had lived in the 1980s, researchers collaborating among multiple institutions such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Revive & Restore, ViaGen Pets & Equine, Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, and the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, recently cloned two individuals and reintroduced them into the breeding program with good results. The total population now numbers “over 300 individuals in the wild”. Combined with efforts to introduce disease resistance this may well lead to a lengthier story for this ancient species. None of these animals have the potential for multiplication and dispersal high enough to justify a blanket moratorium on work towards their re-introduction. Indeed, researchers working with them wish they could have such a problem. Mosquitoes, however, present a more interesting case. Some may be surprised to learn that the world champion killer of humans is not something large and toothy, not a lion, tiger, or even a hippo, but the tiny mosquito, which is responsible for 700,000 human deaths every year. Mosquitoes kill us through the diseases they spread including malaria, Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. Prophylactic measures like insecticide impregnated bed netting are effective, but must be used correctly, and have led to several unanticipated negative consequences . Oxitec is a biotech company based in Oxford, UK. It aims to develop biological control measures aimed at disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks. It has developed several different ‘gene drives’ they hope will spread genetic debility sufficient to decrease wild populations of disease vectors like Aedes aegypti (vector of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever), Aedes albopictus (dengue, chikungunya, zika), Anopheles albimanus (malaria) and Anopheles stephensi (malaria). The company has had successful field trials in Brazil and the Caribbean, and launched its first field trial in Florida in 2021. Opponents of biological innovation have strenuously fought Oxitec’s field trials, despite exhaustive risk assessments by the EPA . These opponents overlook the fact that these mosquitoes are not a keystone species anywhere, and it is by no means clear anybody would lament their absence, indeed quite the contrary. And the arithmetic is pretty simple – opposition based in reason and data would have to conjure a negative impact from developing these and similar biological control measures that would deserve to be considered in the context of the present annual toll of 700,000 deaths. That’s a tall order. Surely there are more important ways IUCN can leverage its clout on behalf of global biodiversity than to indulge such ill-considered and blunt instruments as a moratorium that would stifle valuable innovative technology when it is most needed. Revive & Restore’s Ryan Phelan nailed it when she said “It’s appalling to think that we’re going to just stymie scientists from advancing and using the new tools of biotechnology.” IUCN should take heed.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/14/technophobia-threatens-the-future-of-conservation/
Schumpeter’s Vindication: The Enduring Link Between Scale and Innovation,2025-10-16,Giorgio Castiglia,"Over the past few years, antitrust populists have repeatedly argued that in markets, “ big is bad .” Yet empirical research, including studies conducted by two newly announced Nobel Laureates , has consistently proven otherwise, particularly when it comes to innovation. A recently published paper reinforces this conclusion by analyzing 95 empirical studies and 655 statistical estimates of the effects of size on innovative performance drawn from the literature. Using “meta regression analysis”, the authors found an overall positive average effect of firm size on innovation in the econometric literature. These findings should not be surprising, as influential economist Joseph Schumpeter was unequivocal that large firms are better positioned to increase output and promote economic growth over time by driving innovation. But why? In light of the empirical research and these new findings, it is worth revisiting Schumpeter’s main arguments about the relationship between firm size and innovation, as well as what modern evidence shows. Schumpeter’s analysis suggests that firms with market power have both a greater incentive and ability to innovate. Regarding incentives, a principal Schumpeterian argument is that larger firms with market power have more to lose from disruptive innovation, giving them strong motivation to keep up with what Schumpeter called “ creative destruction ”—the rapid technological changes that leave entrepreneurs standing on ground “crumbling beneath their feet.” In other words, firms with market power that rest on their laurels risk being swept away by the perennial gales of creative destruction. This is particularly true of industries characterized by dynamic competition , where incumbents earn high profits. As Robert Atkinson and Michael Lind explain in Big is Beautiful , “rather than being anti-consumer, these higher returns are a boon to consumers because most innovation companies have to reinvest these profits into the next round of risky innovation to stay alive.” Critics of this view argue that larger firms with market power have a disincentive to innovate because doing so could cannibalize their own products and profits. In other words, such firms might avoid innovation because it eats into the sales of their existing offerings. This argument, however, overlooks the significant role of incremental innovation in driving economic growth. For instance, a recent empirical paper finds that most innovation comes from incumbent firms that improve their existing products. The authors provide evidence that most total factor productivity (TFP) growth from 1983 to 2013 resulted from this “own innovation” by incumbents rather than products from new entrants, which corroborates the Schumpeterian claim that firms with market power often drive economic growth through innovation. A second incentive that Schumpeter identified is that powerful firms can reap large profits from successful innovation when they are able to appropriate the returns. That said, appropriability only exists when a firm is sufficiently insulated from imitators that might free ride on its investments and siphon off the social benefits of the innovation. According to this view, a company must have some market power to ensure that it can capture the gains of its innovative efforts. A counterargument to this comes from a 1962 theoretical paper by economist Kenneth Arrow, who found that competitive firms may have a greater incentive to innovate due to the lure of supercompetitive profits. Arrow demonstrated that, under certain assumptions, competitive firms are more motivated to escape price competition and low profit levels by innovating, compared with monopolists who already earn economic profits. However, empirical research has shown that the relationship between market structure and innovation tends to follow a more Schumpeterian pattern: Innovation rises with market concentration up to a point, then declines. This dynamic, known as the “ inverted U ” relationship, suggests that smaller firms in fragmented markets innovate less than larger firms in oligopolistic ones, while innovation in oligopolies often exceeds that in pure monopolies. Finally, Schumpeter claimed that large firms with market power also have a greater ability to innovate, thanks to greater scale, resources, and financial capacity to engage in high-risk R&D. While some antitrust economists, including Carl Shapiro, opine that modern capital markets diminish this advantage, it is implausible that financial markets alone can provide sufficient funding for innovation, especially in the contemporary context. Indeed, a new ITIF report documents that the R&D spending of American “big tech” firms exceeds the total R&D spending of many foreign nations, and includes hundreds of billions in projected AI investments over the coming years. Given the massive scale of investment and innovation amid the current gales of AI-driven creative destruction, it is unlikely that financial markets alone could provide the same level of optimal and sustained funding. Large firms therefore have both the incentive and ability to invest in innovation—and, as new empirical research suggests, they generally do. This largely vindicates Schumpeter’s central arguments about market structure and innovation, which he himself based on real-world observation. To be sure, as many antitrust scholars argue, enforcers may still be concerned about innovation-limiting effects of market structure in certain contexts. But they should also recognize that scale promotes innovation rather than stifling it. As antitrust economist Carl Shapiro notes , it is an “audacious” task “to distill lessons from the huge and complex literature on competition and innovation that are simple and robust enough to inform competition policy.” Nonetheless, the connection between firm size and innovation has proved remarkably enduring since Schumpeter’s influential work. And, as this year’s Nobel Prize in economics suggests, the benefits of scale for innovation and economic growth deserve renewed and ongoing attention in policy circles.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/16/schumpeters-vindication-the-enduring-link-between-scale-and-innovation/
Fact of the Week: Inflation Is Expected to Rise to 3 Percent in the United States in 2026,2025-10-20,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), “OECD Economic Outlook Interim Report: Finding the Right Balance in Uncertain Times,” (Paris: OECD, 2025). Commentary: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation has been a persistent problem for policymakers and economists, as the cost of living has ballooned while wages have failed to keep pace. Yet, after hitting its peak in 2022 of 9 percent , inflation in the United States has made a steady and controlled descent toward the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2 percent. However, President Trump’s tariffs may stand in the way of that goal. Since the trade disruptions set off by his tariffs began, economists and international organizations have warned of the returning threat of inflation, considering at least a fraction of the cost of tariffs will be passed down to consumers. Though inflation has remained relatively stable thus far in 2025, projections still estimate that inflation in the United States will increase in 2026 from 2.7 percent to 3 percent. Inflation in the Euro Area and G20, in contrast, is projected to decrease.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/20/inflation-expected-to-rise-to-3-percent-in-united-states-in-2026/
"Wake up, Europe. It’s Time to Get Serious About Innovation.",2025-10-16,Ayesha Bhatti; Daniel Castro,"In an era of intense techno-economic competition, particularly from China, the EU’s risk-averse regulatory mindset is contributing to its own decline. Reinvigorating Europe’s competitiveness will require the EU to create a regulatory environment that fully embraces innovation at all levels of policymaking. In 2016, the EU adopted the innovation principle , which calls for EU policy to be “developed, implemented and assessed in view of encouraging innovations that help realise the EU’s environmental, social and economic objectives, and to anticipate and harness future technological advances.” Forming part of the EU’s Better Regulation initiative to reduce regulatory complexity, the principle aimed to encourage beneficial innovation, steer innovations towards promoting EU values, and balance predictability and adaptability. Almost a decade later, the innovation principle still exists on paper but has played no meaningful role in improving or even sharpening EU regulation. Since its founding , the EU has prioritised the precautionary principle , the idea that government should restrict new technologies that present any hypothetical risk because it is better to be safe than sorry. However, as EU business leaders have explained to the European Commission, “innovation is by definition a risk taking activity” that the precautionary principle routinely stifles. The EU created the innovation principle to act as a counterweight. Unfortunately, the innovation principle has failed to shape the EU’s regulatory playbook. Mario Draghi’s damning report to the Commission highlighted the state of European innovation capacity: In the last 50 years, not a single new European company has achieved a market capitalisation over €100 billion, and between 2008 and 2021, 30 percent of European unicorns relocated to the United States. The diagnosis was “self-defeating” regulatory burdens. The EU’s own (and only) evaluation of the innovation principle over five years ago explains why it has failed: It lacks a legal anchor and clear definition, and officials and stakeholders are neither aware of it nor have the skills needed for proper implementation. For example, when the Commission became aware of regulatory gaps and barriers preventing the deployment of an innovative wastewater treatment technology that could have delivered economic and environmental benefits, it declined to amend the relevant rules because any changes might compromise safety. This justification reflects a broader mindset that treats potential risks as grounds for holding back technology , an approach that is impractical and incompatible with the Commission’s ongoing goals to use innovation to boost competitiveness. The precautionary principle dominates EU policymaking, and not just within the Commission but across the European Council and European Parliament too. Neither Member States nor Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) systematically consider the Commission’s Better Regulation impact assessments on proposed regulation, including the mandatory competitiveness check, which means MEPs do not fully appreciate the effect of their amendments on competitiveness or innovation. Europe’s challenge is institutional as much as cultural. The problem is not that all regulators oppose innovation, but that the EU has built a risk-adverse system where stifling innovation carries no political cost and no institution defends it. As a result, the impact on laws and regulations is always a secondary consideration, if policymakers consider it at all, and the EU’s ambitions to boost competitiveness through innovation remain unfulfilled. The fix requires both the Commission and the European Parliament to embed the innovation principle at the core of policymaking. That requires giving the innovation principle the same consideration as the precautionary principle, ensuring it carries real legal force, accountability, and visibility across institutions. For example, the Commission could establish a European Innovation Protection Board (EIPB) that provides a supra-supervisory role over other EU institutions, such as the European Data Protection Board or the EU AI Office, to ensure those entities align with European innovation goals. The EIPB could not only provide advisory services to the Commission and Parliament, but also overrule decisions made by other EU institutions that do not sufficiently account for the impact of their actions on innovation. More fundamentally, the EU needs to embrace a cultural shift to focus less on hypothetical risk and more on tangible benefit. In Europe, new technologies are too often met with a recital of risks and fear of change. By contrast, in the United States and across much of Asia, the instinct is excitement—when will it be on the market? A culture shift towards enthusiastic pursuit of technological opportunities will ensure regulation steers clear of preventing risk by avoiding it altogether, and instead properly balances risk and benefit. The EU’s attempt at embracing the innovation principle has clearly failed. Many European policymakers continue to view emerging technologies as inherent threats. Unless the EU fundamentally reworks its policymaking process to elevate innovation as a primary objective, it will continue to repeat its regulatory mistakes—and fall further behind.

EU Should Improve Transparency in the Digital Services Act Key Takeaways Introduction Content Moderation and Transparency The Digital Services Act Methodology Results Recommendations Conclusion Endnotes,2025-10-20,Ash Johnson; Puja Roy,"The implementation of the Digital Services Act’s transparency obligations fails to provide meaningful insight into online platforms’ content moderation decisions, the extraterritorial effects of the act, and its effects on online speech. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Content Moderation and Transparency 4 The Digital Services Act 5 Methodology 8 Results 9 Analysis 12 Recommendations 14 Conclusion . 16 Endnotes 17 Regulating media to protect consumers while respecting free expression has always been a delicate balancing act. From the invention of the printing press, which made books accessible to the masses, to the advent of radio and television, which brought live entertainment into people’s homes, policymakers and industry stakeholders have grappled with how to facilitate the dissemination of information and entertainment while limiting the spread of illegal and harmful content. To date, no media technology has posed a more complex challenge for both government and industry than social media. Social media allows billions of people around the world to publish information and communicate with others. This unprecedented communications channel has kick-started important social and political movements, connected users with distant friends and family, facilitated the spread of knowledge and ideas, and brought endless entertainment to anyone with an Internet-connected device. However, while social media has undoubtedly transformed society in many positive ways, it has also exacerbated existing challenges and introduced new ones by making it easier than ever to create and spread harmful or illegal content. Moreover, a lack of agreement about what content is harmful makes content moderation decisions politically charged. Thus, content moderation is one of the key challenges social media platforms have to grapple with in today’s globally interconnected online ecosystem. Complicating this further, different governments have taken different approaches to regulating online content, and platforms that offer their services in multiple jurisdictions (i.e., most online services) must comply with all these different regulations. Businesses then must make difficult trade-offs between tailoring their services to each jurisdiction’s rules and standardizing their practices as much as possible across jurisdictions, leading the strictest set of rules to take precedent. The EU’s DSA is one of the most ambitious content moderation regulatory frameworks developed to date. [1] The law applies to social media and other online platforms offering services within the EU. Conceived to “create a safer digital space where the fundamental rights of users are protected,” the DSA establishes strict content moderation for illegal content, as well as accountability and transparency requirements. [2] The DSA’s transparency requirements focus on illuminating platforms’ existing practices. Specifically, Article 17 of the DSA requires online platforms to provide “a clear and specific statement of reasons” each time they remove or restrict content that is illegal or violates a platform’s terms of service. [3] Platforms must submit these statements of reasons to the European Commission’s DSA Transparency Database, which offers tools for the public to access, analyze, and download those statements. [4] This transparency requirement has multiple benefits. First, it helps to avoid infringing on users’ free speech rights. Second, it allows regulators and researchers to measure the scope and effectiveness of different platforms’ content moderation practices. Third, it contributes toward efforts to measure the extent of harmful and illegal content and activity online. Finally, it encourages accountability in the form of fairer and more effective content moderation by making platforms’ actions public. This report focuses on social media platforms, a subset of online platforms that host a large quantity and variety of user-generated content. This feature of social media, as well as certain platforms’ individual content moderation decisions, has generated controversy and global debate over whether platforms effectively balance preventing harm, including to users, while safeguarding free speech. Many policymakers believe platforms have not struck the right balance, leading to regulation such as the DSA. Unless the EU makes changes to the reporting requirements, other countries will have little insight into the potential extraterritorial impact of the law on free speech or the extent to which the EU is imposing its own speech regulations on the rest of the world. The report also explores the impact of the DSA’s transparency requirements on social media content moderation within and outside the EU and the effectiveness of these requirements at providing adequate insight into social media content moderation. In order to do so, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) extracted data from the DSA Transparency Database and then processed this dataset using Python Pandas within a Jupyter Notebook environment. First, this report explains the DSA’s content moderation and transparency provisions, which require online platforms to remove illegal content—including content that violates EU law or the laws of any individual member state—and submit statements of reasons for content moderation decisions, among other measures, and explores the effect these requirements have had in Europe and may have on the rest of the world. Next, it explains the methodology used to evaluate data from the DSA Transparency Database. Then, it presents the findings and analysis from this data, including a lack of important information regarding the types of content social media platforms have restricted or removed and whether those content moderation decisions applied outside the EU. Ultimately, this report shows that the EU DSA’s transparency reporting obligations fail to provide meaningful insight into the impact of the DSA on free speech online, both in the EU and abroad. Unless the EU makes changes to the reporting requirements, other countries will have little insight into the potential extraterritorial impact of the law on free speech or the extent to which the EU is imposing its own speech regulations on the rest of the world. This report offers recommendations for the EU to improve the transparency provisions within the DSA. The European Commission should: ▪ replace vague content removal rationales, such as “scope of platform service,” with clear and specific categories; ▪ separate the category of “illegal or harmful speech” into two categories, “illegal speech” and “harmful speech”; ▪ require online platforms to indicate whether they restricted or removed content for violating European law, including the laws of individual member states, or a separate provision in the platform’s terms of service; and ▪ require online platforms to include information in their statements of reasons on whether they also applied their content moderation decisions in the EU outside the EU. Virtually every online platform, including social media, has terms of service, or a list of rules users must agree to follow in order to use the platform. Typically, these terms include community guidelines that outline content and behavior that is forbidden on the platform, such as depictions of graphic violence, threats of violence, sexually explicit content, promotion of harmful behavior (e.g., eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide), hate speech (as defined by the platform), spam, and more. Community guidelines vary from platform to platform depending on the community the platform wants to foster. For example, a social media platform geared toward an adult audience might have fewer restrictions on sexually explicit content than one geared toward a general audience. Additionally, a platform that prioritizes a more curated online experience might engage in stricter moderation practices than one that prioritizes unrestricted free speech. This freedom of platforms to determine their own rules, within legal boundaries, is important to maintaining a diverse online world. If every platform had to adopt the same community guidelines, users would have less freedom to choose how to express themselves online. The negative impact on free speech is the primary weakness of regulations that would prescribe certain moderation practices for social media platforms. In contrast, regulations that focus more on providing transparency in content moderation aim to address problems of online safety and fairness in content moderation without placing limits on users’ freedom of expression. Rather than dictating platforms’ terms of service or community guidelines, these regulations would instead give insight into how and why platforms make certain content moderation decisions. Regulators can use analysis of this information to hold platforms accountable for enforcing their terms of service and community guidelines fairly across the board. The DSA’s transparency requirements—including those in Article 17, which lays out requirements for transparency surrounding content moderation practices—are an example of this approach. First, by requiring social media and other online platforms to provide clear and easily accessible terms and conditions, the DSA aims to ensure that users understand each platform’s community guidelines. Second, by requiring platforms to submit statements of reasons—information about individual content moderation decisions, including specific actions taken and reasons behind taking those actions—and annual reports on content moderation decisions, the DSA aims to provide insight into platforms’ moderation practices. Third, by requiring platforms to provide certain information about advertisements, the DSA aims to allow consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. And finally, by requiring platforms to provide certain information about their algorithms, the DSA aims to dispel some of the uncertainty around how and why platforms promote certain content and deprioritize other content. If every platform had to adopt the same community guidelines, users would have less freedom to choose how to express themselves online. Taken together, these measures could help increase impartiality in content moderation, which would ideally increase users’ trust in social media platforms. These measures could also increase safety by providing policymakers and stakeholders with greater insight into the challenges social media platforms face and methods they utilize when addressing harmful or illegal content and activity. The DSA is an EU regulation that went into effect in 2022 and applies to all online platforms, including social media networks, e-commerce marketplaces, app stores, and other digital service providers. The DSA exempts online platforms from legal liability for third-party content if they adhere to certain requirements. It also includes transparency and safety obligations for online platforms. The stated goal of the DSA is to make the online world a safer, more predictable, and more trustworthy place by placing obligations on online platforms, including by: ▪ removing illegal content upon receiving an order to do so from a European judicial or administrative authority; ▪ providing information to the authorities on specific users that the platform has already collected upon receiving an order to do so; ▪ providing clear, plain, intelligible, user-friendly, and unambiguous terms and conditions that are publicly available and easy to access; ▪ providing annual reports on content moderation practices; ▪ creating mechanisms for users to report illegal content and responding to those notices by removing the content if the information and allegations within the notice are accurate; ▪ providing a statement of reasons for removing or restricting content and suspending, banning, or restricting a user’s account; ▪ notifying the authorities of suspected offenses that are criminal within the EU; ▪ avoiding deceptive or manipulative interface design; ▪ providing certain information about advertisements on the platform; ▪ providing certain information about algorithms on the platform; ▪ ensuring a high level of privacy, safety, and security for minors; and ▪ imposing additional requirements for “very large online platforms,” including risk assessments, crisis response mechanisms, independent audits, additional advertising transparency, and annual “supervisory fees” paid to the European Commission. The DSA’s transparency requirements for content moderation are contained in Article 17. This section of the DSA requires social media and other online platforms to “provide a clear and specific statement of reasons” when restricting the visibility of content (including removal), suspending or terminating monetization of content, or suspending or terminating a user’s account. [5] The statement of reasons must contain certain information, including which measures the platform took regarding the content (e.g., removal, demonetization, account suspension), why the platform took those measures, whether an automated process found or removed the content, and options for the user to appeal the content moderation decision. [6] The DSA Transparency Database collects these statements of reasons in a publicly accessible format, meaning platforms’ moderation decisions—at least in the EU—are visible not only to regulators but also to the general public within and outside the EU. Before the DSA, social media and other online platforms were not required to provide transparency around their content moderation decisions. Some platforms had already established voluntary transparency measures, such as Google’s Transparency Report, or oversight measures, such as Meta’s Oversight Board, but these measures are not universal. [7] The so-called “black box” of content moderation has raised concerns over safety and fairness: Are social media platforms doing enough to remove illegal content and content that violates their terms of service? [8] And are they enforcing their terms and conditions in a uniform way? Increased transparency surrounding content moderation is one way to address these concerns, and Article 17 of the DSA is the first major attempt to implement such measures via regulation. If it is successful in increasing transparency and trust in social media platforms, countries outside Europe may want to replicate the DSA’s approach, because while the DSA’s content moderation rules may have an extraterritorial impact, its transparency provisions only apply to content moderation decisions in the EU. Although the DSA is an EU regulation, its effects have the potential to impact other countries due to the global nature of many social media and other online platforms. Large online services, in particular—such as social media and e-commerce platforms—often operate in multiple regions and must comply with many different countries’ laws. As a result, these platforms may choose to apply certain DSA standards globally to maintain consistency and simplify compliance across markets. This raises concerns over regulatory overreach, regulatory imperialism, and the extraterritorial application of the DSA. Regulatory overreach occurs when laws in one jurisdiction reach into other regions, sometimes unintentionally and sometimes by design. The DSA does not require platforms to take down illegal content outside the EU, meaning platforms could simply disable content that is illegal in certain countries only in those countries while leaving it up for users in other countries. However, social media platforms may choose to apply the DSA’s relatively strict approach to content moderation globally to simplify compliance, thereby impacting users outside the EU. For example, they could remove or restrict content that would be allowed in non-EU regions, thus affecting global content availability and user experience. Content moderation aside, the DSA applies to all online platforms that offer their services in EU countries. Moreover, with its additional requirements for “very large online platforms,” the DSA targets predominantly American firms, effectively punishing them for their success. EU policymakers and proponents of the DSA maintain that the law does not censor speech. [9] But many U.S. policymakers, global companies, and civil society organizations have their doubts. [10] A 2024 report by the Future of Free Speech, a nonpartisan think tank, finds that, under the DSA, “Legal online speech made up most of the removed content from posts on Facebook and YouTube in France, Germany, and Sweden.” [11] Depending on the sample, between 87.5 percent and 99.7 percent of deleted comments were legally permissible, with Germany having the highest percentage of deleted legal speech. Additionally, a 2025 report by House Judiciary Committee Republicans finds that the DSA was forcing companies to change their global content moderation policies and targeted political speech, humor, and satire. [12] While the United States has led the world in technological innovation, Europe has taken a different road by leading the world in technological regulation. Regulatory imperialism describes one country’s or region’s outsized influence on other countries’ policies. In the case of the EU, this is known as the Brussels effect. In part due to a lack of American action and leadership on digital policy, and in part due to the EU’s extraterritorial regulation—including the DSA—many countries have modeled their own tech regulations after Europe’s. Via the Brussels effect, the EU has taken a global lead on certain digital policy issues, exporting its approach outside its borders and even into the United States. [13] While the United States has led the world in technological innovation, Europe has taken a different road by leading the world in technological regulation. This is a symptom of Europe’s precautionary approach to innovation driven by fears—mostly unfounded—of technology’s potential negative impact on society. [14] This means that, in most cases, the Brussels effect has been a net negative for the United States’ pro-innovation approach to digital policy. Regardless of the effectiveness of the DSA’s transparency requirements, the United States should remain cautious when it comes to the law’s other provisions, of which extraterritorial application could have implications for free speech in the United States and beyond. Europe’s restrictions on speech are stricter than the United States’, and if social media platforms use the EU’s standard for content moderation outside the EU for the sake of simplified compliance, this will affect American and global users’ ability to express themselves freely online. The current Trump administration has raised concerns over the DSA’s potential impact on free speech multiple times. In February 2025, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum directing his administration to “prevent the unfair exploitation of American innovation” and named the DSA as one of many actions by foreign governments that would face scrutiny. [15] Then in May 2025, the State Department sent letters requesting “examples of government efforts to limit freedom of speech,” including the DSA, which one State Department official categorized as part of “the global censorship-industrial complex.” [16] For this research, ITIF extracted data from the DSA Transparency Database, focusing on a 24-hour span of content moderation actions taken on July 31, 2024. The dataset, originally in CSV format, was substantial, containing millions of rows. To manage the large volume of data, ITIF merged all CSV files into a single dataset and then processed this dataset using Python Pandas within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The key data points analyzed include the following: ▪ Platform name: Which platform removed the content? ▪ Content type: What type of content was removed (e.g., text, image, video)? ▪ Category of statement of reasons: What category does the reason for content removal or restriction fall under (e.g., hate speech, privacy violation)? ▪ Decision visibility: What decision was made regarding the visibility of the content (e.g., removed, disabled, demonetized)? ▪ Decision on account: What actions were taken concerning the account that posted the content (e.g., suspension, account removal)? ▪ Automated detection: Was the content flagged by automated detection systems? ▪ Automated decision: Was the content moderation decision made by an automated system? ▪ Source type: Was the content removed voluntarily by the platform or in response to a notice? This range of metrics provided a comprehensive view of content moderation actions across multiple platforms. ITIF ran a statistical analysis of content removal trends based on statements, breaking down this data by platform to see which services were most active in content moderation, whether content moderation decisions were driven by internal platform policies or external legal frameworks, the type of content most frequently targeted by content moderation decisions, and the level of automation involved in detecting and removing content. ITIF’s analysis of the DSA Transparency Database indicates a number of trends in content moderation decisions and their impact across different platforms. These key patterns relate to categories of restricted content, types of decisions, and automation or human consideration. Figure 1: Categories of online platforms’ statements of reasons (excluding “scope of platform service”) Online platforms had several categories to choose from when selecting the reason content was restricted or removed. Unfortunately, many platforms chose the vague category “scope of platform service.” Platforms can choose this category when the platform decides that the moderated content violates its community guidelines or terms of service, such as content in an unsupported language, involving nudity, or referring to prohibited goods or services. Given the variety of reasons contained within this category, including overlap with other categories, it provides little insight into what rule or law the content violated. Figure 1 charts those statements that were for a more specific category, revealing that “illegal or harmful speech” was by far the most common reason platforms restricted or removed content, indicating the potential effect the DSA has on online speech. For example, certain content is illegal in certain European countries that is not illegal in other countries, including the United States—such as Holocaust denial in Germany. Additionally, there is a major difference between illegal speech and speech that is legal but considered harmful. The latter category often requires highly subjective analysis on issues for which reasonable people’s opinions can differ. Pornographic content, unsafe or illegal products, scams and fraud, and violent content also made up significant portions of content restricted or removed; however, these categories carry fewer free speech concerns. Content judged to have a negative effect on civic discourse or elections, another category with strong ties to free speech, made up a relatively small portion of content restricted or removed. Across all online platforms, the most common response to problematic content was to disable the content rather than remove it entirely (see figure 2). The ability of platforms to disable content only in certain locations allows platforms to adhere to country- or region-specific rules, including the DSA, without impacting the availability of that content worldwide. The prevalence of disabling rather than removing content is a promising signal that social media platforms may not apply the EU’s content rules around the world. However, when it comes to content containing illegal or harmful speech, online platforms overwhelmingly removed the content rather than disabling or otherwise restricting it, with these decisions representing over 98 percent of decisions made regarding this type of content (see figure 3). Since there is no data in the DSA Transparency Database to indicate whether platforms removed content for violating their own terms of service rather than European law, it is difficult to determine the impact of the DSA and other European regulations on global content moderation and online free speech. Figure 2: Decisions online platforms made regarding content visibility Figure 3: Decisions online platforms made regarding content containing illegal or harmful speech Finally, online platforms provided information in their statements of reasons on the extent to which automated tools played a role in content detection and removal. Ninety-seven percent of content detection was automated and over half of content removal decisions were fully automated, indicating a high level of automation in content moderation (see figure 4). This approach has some major benefits, as well as potential risks. Automated content detection and removal is faster and cheaper than human moderation and avoids issues that might stem from human bias. But it also prevents human moderators from being repeatedly exposed to horrific violent or sexually graphic content that can cause serious negative mental health impacts. [17] Since there is no data in the DSA Transparency Database to indicate whether platforms removed content for violating their own terms of service rather than European law, it is difficult to determine the impact of the DSA and other European regulations on global content moderation and free speech. However, automated tools can miss important context that human moderators might be more likely to catch, which may lead platforms to remove content that is not problematic or miss content that is problematic. [18] Ideally, as technology advances, these tools will become increasingly sophisticated, reducing concerns over accuracy and reliability. However, there is likely no way to ensure that content moderation is 100 percent accurate, regardless of whether platforms use human moderators, automated tools, or a combination of both, especially since many content moderation decisions are highly subjective and reasonable people can disagree as to the best way to respond to certain content. Figure 4: Online platforms’ use of automated content detection and decision-making (57.4 million decisions sampled on July 31, 2024) Analysis There were multiple barriers to drawing detailed conclusions based on the data contained in the DSA Transparency Database, primarily related to a lack of detail in that data. While it is important to both consider the burden transparency requirements may pose on social media and other online platforms and avoid imposing overly burdensome requirements, it is equally important to ensure that transparency requirements do what they set out to do: in this case, provide insight into social media platforms’ content moderation practices. The first barrier was vague categorization. When categorizing why platforms restricted or removed content, the overwhelming majority—nearly 90 percent—of statements fell into the category labeled “scope of platform service” (see figure 5). This incredibly vague category includes any content that the online platform submitting the statement forbids according to its terms and conditions and community guidelines, and thus encompasses many different categories of content and types of harm, from violence and nudity to hate speech and election misinformation. ITIF excluded these statements from its analysis due to their vagueness. Figure 5: Categories of online platforms’ statements of reasons The second barrier was a lack of information as to what actions platforms took that affected users outside the EU. Platforms were only required to state which countries within the EU were affected by content moderation decisions. Given that the vast majority of affected content violated platforms’ terms of service, it would stand to reason that platforms removed or restricted this content globally and not only within the EU; however, the DSA Transparency Database does not provide this information. Thus, analysis of the DSA Transparency Database alone cannot answer questions regarding potential extraterritorial application of the DSA. Finally, a barrier ITIF encountered in its research that has since been resolved was the lack of an application programming interface (API) that researchers could use to analyze the data within the DSA Transparency Database. The European Commission made such an API available in February of 2025, after ITIF had concluded its data collection. [19] While ITIF was still able to analyze the data from within a 24-hour period using third-party tools, it will be easier going forward for other researchers to analyze DSA transparency data. Previous research supports ITIF’s findings that the DSA’s transparency mechanisms are insufficient. For example, a 2025 study by researchers from Italy finds inconsistencies between the DSA Transparency Database and VLOPs’ (Very Large Online Platforms’) transparency reports. [20] A separate 2024 study by researchers from the Netherlands finds that the database allows platforms to “remain opaque on the grounds behind content moderation decisions,” particularly for content moderation decisions based on terms of service infringements. [21] The report claims that “platforms can strategize their use of the database as a means to show their compliance, even though in practice it may be insufficient.” [22] Despite these barriers, the data within the DSA Transparency Database provided some insight into content moderation trends in Europe. Above all, it revealed a large variation of content moderation patterns and priorities between different social media platforms. This variation is a key feature of the digital ecosystem for multiple reasons. First, it provides users with a variety of different online experiences to choose from, from heavily moderated spaces that prioritize a specific user experience to more lightly moderated spaces that prioritize free speech. Second, it promotes competition between social media platforms. If a social media platform changes how it moderates content in a way that some users do not like, those users can move to another platform that more closely aligns with their wants and needs. While it is important to consider the burden transparency requirements may pose on social media and other online platforms and avoid imposing overly burdensome requirements, it is equally important to ensure that transparency requirements do what they set out to do. Therefore, it is crucial that regulation of social media platforms preserve platforms’ ability to tailor their own content moderation practices to the user base they wish to cultivate. If every platform were forced to abide by a strict set of moderation practices, consumers would have limited choices and smaller or emerging social media platforms would have fewer ways to attract new users by differentiating themselves from existing, dominant platforms. The data within the Transparency Database also revealed that platforms proactively and voluntarily moderate the vast majority of content. In other words, social media and other online platforms primarily restrict or remove content that their own human moderators, automated systems, or users flag and report, rather than waiting to receive a takedown notice or government order (see figure 6). Mainstream platforms do not want to host illegal content or other content that violates their terms of service, not only to avoid liability for the content, but also to avoid harming their users and damaging their own reputation among users and advertisers. Most users do not want to use platforms that are riddled with harassment, violence, hate speech, scams, and exploitation. Likewise, most companies do not want advertisements for their products and services to appear alongside these types of content. Figure 6: Sources of online platforms’ content restriction or removal While these trends of variety on content moderation and voluntary removal of problematic content are encouraging, partial or inconsistent reporting, vague categorization, and a complete lack of data on the extraterritorial effects of content moderation in the EU indicate significant room for improvement. Transparency requirements are ineffective at best and superfluous at worst if they do not fully reveal important information about platforms’ practices. Reforms to these requirements would facilitate increased trust and accountability across the digital ecosystem. In order to provide true transparency into social media platforms’ content moderation practices in the EU, the European Commission should reform the DSA transparency requirements to address challenges posed by partial or inconsistent reporting, vague categorization, and a lack of data on the extraterritorial effects of the DSA. There are four specific and relatively minor reforms that would solve these problems. First, the European Commission should remove the statement category “scope of platform service” for online platforms reporting why they restricted or removed certain content. This category is vague and unhelpful in providing transparency into platforms’ content moderation practices, and the DSA cannot meaningfully accomplish true transparency in content moderation as long as the vast majority of statements fall into this category as they currently do. If needed, the European Commission should also expand the list of categories platforms can choose from when reporting why they restricted or removed content if the current categories do not cover the breadth of platforms’ reasons. These new categories should be specific enough to illuminate the specific European law or platform policy the content violated. Second, the European Commission should separate the category of “illegal or harmful speech” into two categories—“illegal speech” and “harmful speech”—as the free speech implications of each are very different. Illegal speech is defined by law, and online platforms are obligated to remove it under the DSA, whereas harmful speech is a subjective category not defined in the DSA that platforms are not required to remove but often choose to remove. Reasonable people can disagree on what constitutes “harmful speech,” and when platforms remove too much speech—including speech that is merely controversial—they have deemed “harmful,” free speech suffers. Third, the European Commission should require online platforms in their statements of reasons to indicate whether platforms restricted or removed content for violating European law or a separate provision in the platforms’ terms of service. Combined with the first reform, this would indicate to researchers and policymakers the extent to which the DSA impacts content moderation in the EU. If platforms would already remove certain content for violating their terms of service, then the DSA likely has little impact on the availability of that content. However, if platforms are more motivated by European law than by their own policies, then global policymakers and free speech advocates may have more cause for concern. Fourth, the European Commission should require online platforms in their statements of reasons to include information on whether their content moderation decisions in the EU, such as restricting or removing content or banning or suspending users, were also applied outside the EU. For example, if a platform removes content containing hate speech that is illegal in certain European countries but legal in other countries such as the United States, did it remove that content globally, or can users in non-European countries still see it? These are the kinds of decisions that have the biggest potential to negatively impact free speech around the world. The rest of the world should not be subject to European laws. The European Commission should reform the DSA transparency requirements to address challenges posed by partial or inconsistent reporting, vague categorization, and a lack of data on the extraterritorial effects. Together, these four changes would solve the lack of adequate transparency in the DSA. Requiring more detailed reasons from platforms as to why they made certain content moderation decisions would allow governments and researchers to track trends in content moderation in the EU in greater detail, informing policy decisions and hopefully increasing users’ trust in those platforms. Additionally, platforms would no longer be wasting their own time and resources submitting statements of reasons that provide only a limited amount of transparency. Meanwhile, requiring platforms to reveal the global impact of their content moderation decisions in Europe would shed light on concerns of regulatory overreach and extraterritorial impact. If the data reveals that the DSA and other EU laws do impact the types of content that are available to users worldwide, other countries could take steps to mitigate that impact. If, on the other hand, the data does not show such an impact—either because platforms are removing content only in Europe while maintaining its availability elsewhere or because platforms would remove that content regardless because it violates their terms of service—then the EU can dispel and disprove concerns of extraterritorial impact. Until then, the lack of data will continue to fuel concerns and create friction between the EU and other parts of the world. Analysis of data from the DSA Transparency Database reveals some positive trends in content moderation in the EU, such as variety among social media platforms’ content moderation practices and proactive rather than reactive content moderation. However, there are multiple barriers in this database that prevent in-depth analysis of content moderation trends in Europe, the DSA’s impact on free speech, and its potential extraterritorial impact. The European Commission could address these barriers with relatively minor changes to the DSA, which would ensure true transparency as well as address concerns over the DSA’s potential impact on global content moderation.

Fact of the Week: US R&D Value Added Has Increased by 63 Percent from 2013 to 2023,2025-10-14,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: Conor Gowder, “Useful Stats: R&D’s Contributions to State Economies” (SSTI, September 24, 2025). Commentary: Research and development (R&D) has been proven to increase innovation and support economic growth, thus leading policymakers to design economic development policies focused on increasing R&D activity. A key measure of R&D activity and success is R&D value added, which measures the value generated by R&D minus the cost of its inputs, such as energy, materials, and services. According to the BEA’s R&D Satellite Account, R&D value added has increased in real terms from 2013 to 2023 by 63 percent.

Rethinking Antitrust: The Case for Dynamic Competition Policy Key Takeaways Introduction Static vs. Dynamic Competition Hayek’s Model of Dynamic Competition Schumpeterian Competition Comparative Analysis Summary and Implications Conclusion Endnotes,2025-10-14,Giorgio Castiglia,"Antitrust policy relies too heavily on static models that focus on prices and market shares while treating innovation as external. A dynamic approach that views competition as a process of innovation is better suited to guiding policy in today’s technology-driven economy. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 3 Static vs. Dynamic Competition . 4 Hayek’s Model of Dynamic Competition . 7 Schumpeterian Competition . 9 Comparative Analysis 11 Summary and Implications 13 Conclusion . 15 Endnotes 16 It has long been noted that antitrust law depends on economics probably more than any other branch of the law does. [1] This has become known as the “economic construction” of antitrust law. [2] Today, proposals abound for rethinking the interaction between economics and antitrust law given that the “Chicago/Harvard” approach, which relied chiefly on static neoclassical analysis, has come under fire in the academic literature, as well as in public discussion. [3] Antitrust enforcers that rose to prominence under the Biden administration attempted to move away from the old consensus by aggressively pursuing a Neo-Brandeisian agenda, which, at a foundational level, elevated political concerns over economic ones. [4] Enforcement under this agenda underperformed on critical measures and left antitrust institutions in a greater state of frailty. [5] Enforcers in the second Trump administration, while different, appear as though they will maintain some of the components of this Neo-Brandeisian approach, particularly its concern with the economic and political power of large technology companies. [6] However, they are also concerned with static approaches to enforcement that treat price and quantity as the only dimensions in which competition takes place, leaving the door open for new paradigms and standards for antitrust. [7] The Trump administration’s America First antitrust program will likely fail to change enforcement in a positive way if it continues to pursue a “big is bad” approach that has misguided the Neo-Brandeisians. Large firm size is principally a response to market factors such as new technology that make increasing returns to scale possible. Large firms also are in many cases more successful at serving consumer needs due to the lower costs of scale and the presence of demand-side network effects that increase user benefits from a smaller number of larger platforms. Meanwhile, large firms’ scale is conducive to driving a virtuous cycle of new investment in innovation. [8] In this context, there is a clear need for a new way to think about competition in the disruptive economy that exists today—a policy model that fully accounts for market dynamics and innovation. Indeed, others have called for new standards that examine how conduct under scrutiny affects the process of economic competition. [9] Incorporating a process view of competition will require taking seriously economic theories that reduce the importance of static equilibrium concepts and elevate the importance of human action, such as entrepreneurship. This will aid in considering the different dimensions of competition. Particularly in the technology sector, competition often occurs along the dimension of innovation as opposed to the price competition that has long been the dominant focus of mainstream antitrust analysis. In these technology and innovation-driven industries, firms compete for, rather than within, the market in sequential innovation races. [10] Hayek and Schumpeter are two 20th century economists who criticized static models and favored a dynamic process view of how economic competition works. They both provide useful frameworks for how to think about competition today, particularly in rapidly changing digital markets. This report provides a comparison of their views on competition and argues that they can be woven together to build a better economic foundation for antitrust law and enforcement. This foundation shares significant similarities with the former Chicago/Harvard consumer welfare approach to antitrust policy, but with a much greater emphasis on the dynamic process of innovation competition as a supplement to static welfare analysis. Antitrust policy today is in crisis. Political concerns that often conflict with economic ones have come to the fore, and enforcement is still out of step with market realities for innovation-driven industries. Against that backdrop, this report seeks to provide an understanding of how the dynamic competition framework responds to the current antitrust crisis by adding a process view that enforcers can use in addition to static competition models. It grounds dynamic competition in the theory of important economists such as Schumpeter and Hayek, which helps demonstrate that the approach has not been developed in service of special interest groups, but rather has been developed over decades. Yet, it has not been made operational for policy. Economists, lawyers, and practitioners are beginning to develop practical guides for competition policy that rely on this framework, which is especially important for modern technology sectors that are experiencing rapid change through continuous disruptive innovation. [11] This report seeks to aid in that pursuit, proceeding in five sections: ▪ The first section generally reviews the difference between static and dynamic models of competition, and why a dynamic competition approach should form the cornerstone of competition policy. Importantly, the growing literature on dynamic competition uses “dynamic” to refer to models that not only incorporate competition over time, but also treat economic competition as a process that does not necessarily resolve toward an equilibrium. ▪ The second section discusses Hayek’s specific theory of competition as a dynamic discovery procedure. It explains how Hayek attempted to fill the gap in understanding real-world competitive conduct left unexplained by the static, perfectly competitive model. The section includes a discussion of the role of market structure and the importance of markets in solving the economic calculation problem. ▪ The third section provides a similar discussion of Schumpeterian competition, with emphasis on how innovation and “creative destruction” form the essential driving force of the market system. It emphasizes how Schumpeter sees innovation as driven by large firms and the important spirit of entrepreneurship that propels economic growth. ▪ The fourth section offers a comparative study of the insights about market competition provided by Hayek and Schumpeter and highlights how they complement one another in ways useful to competition policy. By adding the dimension of competition through innovation, Schumpeter augments the Hayekian approach to help understand rapidly changing markets. ▪ The fifth section provides a nonexhaustive list of some of the practical implications of the dynamic competition approach for antitrust and competition policy. The first step in analyzing market competition as a dynamic process is to distinguish between “static” and “dynamic” competition. These two terms have their basis in the economic literature, which distinguishes between static and dynamic economic models. The static approach to competition treats technology and innovation as constant and examines the outcomes of business practices on indicators of welfare, such as prices and consumer surplus. [12] In general, static models examine behavior and the equilibrium outcomes of that behavior from a particular point in time. Dynamic models, by contrast, seek to show how changes in circumstances can affect economic outcomes over multiple periods or stages. A fully dynamic approach that incorporates the vision of Hayek and Schumpeter views competition as a process : innovation and technological change are essential and endogenous aspects of competition in many markets, and treating them as constant will lead to an inaccurate picture of competition in the modern innovation economy. Static models tend to focus on the concept of equilibrium, meaning a point that the economy tends toward given assumptions about human behavior and technological possibilities. [13] In static models, all variables are stationary until change is caused by uncontrollable forces outside the model. This causes the variables inside the model to adjust. These models allow us to make predictions about what will happen to prices and output in the face of exogenous changes, such as a natural disaster or technological improvement. For instance, if a natural disaster reduces the supply of oranges in Florida, then high-value orange consumers will have to bid up the price. However, it leaves the process of change unexamined and simply assumed, focusing instead on the ultimate equilibrium outcome. In other words, in the static model, nothing will change unless there is some exogenous force that compels allocations to change, such as innovation and technological improvement. Static models can also be used to compare differences in one end state from another, referred to in economics as “comparative statics.” This method of analysis is best used to examine the results of what happens before and after an intervention, but the comparison is between different static end states. Therefore, examining changes over a long period of time—although “dynamic” in the sense of analyzing outcomes over time—is also qualitatively a static exercise from the point of view of the dynamic competition approach. For example, an empirical difference-in-differences approach to examining competitive conduct, such as a merger, looks at changes in variables before and after a specific event to gauge the effect of an intervention. This is essentially static, because the emphasis is on the resulting outcomes, not on the process of competition. In sum, “dynamic” models that incorporate time can still be “static,” meaning the key focus is on equilibrium rather than process. Static competition occurs when firms compete on the basis of existing technologies, by cutting costs and otherwise competing on the margins. For instance, under a static competition framework, an incumbent firm’s behavior might be observed when an entrant is considering entering an existing product market in which the incumbent operates. If the incumbent earns high profits for an extended period of time without entry of new firms into the market, it may be a worrisome sign that market failure or anticompetitive conduct is occurring according to the static approach. The model of perfect competition, for instance, is a well-known example of a static model that assumes that all sellers have access to the same production technologies and that they supply goods that are homogenous. In this model, high profits and prices above costs should be reduced by the entry of rivals into the market. [14] High market shares and levels of concentration are taken to mean that competition has failed. Many models expand on static analysis by incorporating multiple stages of decision-making or periods of adjustment into the models. As noted, the focus in these models is typically still on the equilibrium that the economy will approach over time. Most importantly, these models still treat innovation as exogenous, meaning they fail to account for innovation as an essential component of market competition. Thus, the use of dynamic models that analyze long-term equilibrium outcomes can still be lumped into the “static” approach to competition. Dynamic economic models that focus on equilibrium rather than process are not examples of the dynamic competition paradigm. A true dynamic approach to competition advocated by scholars such as Hayek and Schumpeter goes further by treating competition as a process. The meaning of “process” is that change is not exogenous. Economic change is the main event to be studied rather than the equilibrium that the economy shifts toward in the face of an exogenous change. Therefore, the term “dynamic,” as it is used in the dynamic competition paradigm, refers to analysis that, more than analyzing behavior over time, also grapples with the process of economic change itself. [15] The dynamic approach to competition recognizes that constant change is inherent in market economies and that this means an emphasis on equilibrium, a point of stasis, is not comprehensive for understanding the actual behavior of firms. [16] Some real-world examples that embody the basic theory of dynamic competition are the following: ▪ Amazon spent significant resources to develop the Kindle e-reader, even though its core business at the time revolved around selling books. [17] A significant quote from a former Amazon executive was that it is “better to cannibalize yourself than have someone else do it.” [18] ▪ Kodak, once thought of as a monopolist, is an obsolete company that refused to invest in innovating because it was afraid of cannibalizing its own profitable lines of business. [19] ▪ Firms such as Apple, Samsung, and Google continually invest in developing and launching improved devices, such as smartphones, for fear that a rival will take advantage of continuous improvements in technologies to release devices that will make them obsolete. ▪ Google incorporates AI into its search service, given the propensity of many adopters to prefer AI tools for search services rather than traditional search engines. [20] ▪ Nvidia’s invests over the course of decades to transition from a computer graphics chip company to a supplier of advance processors to fuel the current wave of AI. [21] These examples provide some intuition about dynamic competition. It means competing by innovating and continuously improving to stay ahead of rivals through creative destruction, often of a firm’s own products. Under the framework of dynamic competition, many business practices that seem inscrutable or even monopolistic are seen through a new lens as competition on another dimension: innovation. Innovation industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technology, and it can take large amounts of effort and research and development (R&D) to incorporate new advancements into existing products and create new products and services. [22] And yet, the marginal costs of production or providing another unit of service to a user are often zero. In other words, firms in innovation industries often have enormous fixed costs and low or zero marginal costs. [23] When marginal cost is zero, average costs decrease as output increases. For digital platforms, this can be combined with demand-side network effects, meaning users benefit from a service the more other people use it. [24] Because of this, firms in innovation industries are often uniquely positioned to take advantage of economies of scale. [25] Firms have to react and adapt to continuously changing circumstances in order to survive. Dynamic competition emphasizes the introduction of new opportunities to the market via new methods of production and new products as the essence of how firms compete in a capitalist economy. [26] It takes increasing economic welfare as the ultimate normative goal of policy, and innovation—the invention of productivity-enhancing technologies and their diffusion throughout the economy—as the ultimate driver of welfare and economic growth over time. [27] The dynamic competition paradigm adds a new criterium to the practical analysis of monopoly. If a firm has high profits and market share for an extended period of time and further fails to innovate and compete dynamically and is still insulated from entry or innovation by other firms, then that firm may qualify as a monopolist and should be investigated for anticompetitive conduct. [28] One model for understanding dynamic competition can be found in the work of F.A. Hayek. Hayek viewed competition as taking place in a world of uncertainty and incomplete information. The key to understanding the success of the market in fostering economic growth is its role in coordinating the myriad activities of market participants who have set out to achieve only their own ends. Hayek’s answer was that the ever-changing system of prices in a market economy achieved this coordination in a spontaneous fashion. Market competition acts as a procedure for discovering the prices that will best coordinate social plans. While Hayek was inspired by Adam Smith’s “invisible hand,” he did not rely on Smith’s “static” economic reasoning. [29] Rather, Hayek viewed the market as a process of competition wherein buyers and sellers continuously discover the opportunities presented by the market given underlying supply and demand conditions and continuously changing consumer wants, desires, and needs. From the perspective of Hayek, static equilibrium models are unsatisfactory for an understanding of much economic activity because the large industrial economies economists are trying to understand experience constant change. This observable fact about the economy means that models that assume an unchanging world are unlikely to be helpful: one can’t understand change if it is assumed not to exist. The more important role of economics is to explain the process by which this equilibrium is brought about. [30] For Hayekians, society’s principal economic problem is how knowledge is shared throughout the economy, making it possible for the myriad producers and consumers to coordinate their plans in a world of finite resources that is constantly changing. In other words, because markets are dynamic, the underlying data of the markets is always changing, and never simply “given.” [31] In a fundamental sense, this constant change is the reason markets exist in the first place. [32] Hayek pointed to the price system as the mechanism that achieves this social coordination by communicating to individuals how they must adjust their economic activity in response to changes in underlying economic conditions. [33] However, prices themselves are not simply set, but rather are the result of the competitive process itself. [34] The competitive process establishes prices, which in turn help solve the knowledge problem by communicating underlying economic conditions to market participants. This is why Hayek referred to competition as a “discovery procedure.” [35] This is in contrast, of course, to static competition model assumptions that prices are given parameters that individuals must adjust themselves to and thus, in a way, assumes away the knowledge problem. [36] Hayek’s meaning of “competition” is therefore very different from that of the static approach. In fact, he viewed the model of perfect competition as requiring the complete absence of the kinds of competition—lowering prices, advertising, etc.—that we constantly see in the real world. [37] This kind of competition is the very process by which producers discover what consumers value the most and which productive methods work best to serve them. [38] In the static case, no producer is capable of setting a price above the cost of production. Hayek recognized that this is seldom the case in real markets, and, even if it were, the perfectly competitive state of affairs may not be desirable. Hayek’s conception of competition is generally viewed as decentralized. The fact that the knowledge needed to coordinate economic activity is dispersed throughout the various individuals in the economy means individuals and firms with unique knowledge of their local surroundings are more capable of harmonizing social plans through the use of market prices than a centralized planning board could be. [39] This, as well as the appearance of Hayek’s price system to be a decentralized ideal has caused some to claim that Hayek would advocate for an active deconcentration antitrust policy. [40] However, this is a flawed interpretation. The nature of the knowledge problem implies that policymakers cannot know a priori what levels of concentration are appropriate for a given industry. [41] This is part of what the process of competition has to figure out. Hayek’s view of competition as a discovery procedure in which market participants create market prices through the process of exchange suggests that different market structures could be one method by which efficient production is discovered. If we knew what levels of concentration were appropriate, there would be no need to allow the market to experiment with mergers at all. In his essay “The Meaning of Competition,” Hayek asserted that this in fact cannot be known and that the type of organization that will serve the needs of consumers in the best manner is determined by the process of competition. [42] Hayek went on to explain this view even more explicitly in Law, Legislation, and Liberty : “The most effective size of the individual firm is as much one of the unknowns to be discovered by the market process as the prices, quantities or qualities of the goods to be produced and sold.” [43] Market structure is not an exogenous fact to be taken as given in the analysis of competition and market performance. Structure is one of the subjects of economic analysis itself that economists should attempt to explain. Some markets may evolve to become more concentrated over time, and concentration may wax and wane. This is a process that is not well understood within theories that focus on equilibrium outcomes. If market economies constantly change, they do so because of the actions of individuals, namely entrepreneurs. Israel Kirzner extended Hayek’s discussion of the knowledge problem and competition as an economic process by outlining an economic conception of the role of the entrepreneur. [44] It is the entrepreneur who engages in the process of pushing prices closer to a point of equilibrium. Everyone can be an entrepreneur, the distinguishing characteristic of which is an alertness to opportunities for profit. [45] It is this activity that moves the economy closer to equilibrium. Due to constant change, the economy is always in a state of disequilibrium, and entrepreneurs compete in the process of discovering the various production methods and exchange opportunities that will move the market toward equilibrium. The market is imperfect, but the nature of the market and entrepreneurial activity is that this imperfection implies profit opportunities, the exploitation of which pushes the economy closer toward equilibrium outcomes. [46] For Hayek, the institutional context in which individual action occurs is paramount. Rules and norms circumscribe and guide individual actions that affect the overall order or pattern that results from that behavior. This includes entrepreneurs, whose actions are a product of their institutional environment. Entrepreneurial action is not the result of certain social values or ideas, but rather the response of individuals responding to the market incentives provided by their local surroundings and social rules that govern their environment. Entrepreneurs act on their perception of profit opportunities but are constrained by norms and rules of just conduct. The Schumpeterian notion of competition represents, in a way, an even more dynamic approach than Hayek’s. That is, Schumpeterian competition, while not only compatible with the dynamic competitive process discussed by Hayek, goes farther in establishing innovation, and the process of creative destruction, as the driver of economic change and growth. Innovation and creative destruction, not price discovery, typify the nature of the competitive process. Schumpeter made the connection between innovation and economic growth in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy in 1942. [47] Yet, seminal articles on economic growth left technological improvement as an exogenous variable, unexplainable by their models for decades thereafter. [48] Incorporating innovation as an endogenous variable has become an increasingly important research program since the late 20th century. [49] Schumpeter also noted that it was these large enterprises that tended to innovate the most and thus drive long run growth. [50] Schumpeter was frustrated with the use of the model of perfect competition as a benchmark because it assumes away the essential nature of actual competition in market economies. By introducing the concept of creative destruction, Schumpeter refuted the successive attacks on market efficiency that arose in the 20th century. Adam Smith’s competitive system showed that self-interested individuals, guided by the institutions of private property and voluntary exchange, would promote social welfare as a byproduct of their own profit-seeking behavior. Formalizing the perfectly competitive model mathematically, economists such as Alfred Marshall showed that this is theoretically true, but only under certain restrictive assumptions. Economists in the 20th century then called into question the efficiency of markets by creating new models where these assumptions no longer held. For example, if a firm has higher-than-average profit levels, it is likely due to lessened competition and inefficiency in comparison with perfect competition. Contra Smith, profits are no longer socially beneficial, but exploitative. With creative destruction, Schumpeter sweeps away the relevance of the perfect competition model for appraising the performance of capitalism. Creative destruction, the “essential fact” of capitalism, is caused by the introduction of entirely new forms of competition, such as new products and new production processes. This kind of competition “strikes not at the margins” of incumbents’ profits and market shares, but rather “at their foundations and their very lives.” [51] Firms that successfully engage in creative destruction can earn outsize profits for a time due to the fact they introduced something new to the market. This is dynamically efficient because it increases economic growth. The ability to set prices above costs is no longer seen as a failure of the market system to promote welfare, but in fact a principal driver of it. Schumpeter thus restored the beneficial role of profits by noting that they are what enable firms to invest in R&D and to ensure sufficient incentives to innovate. [52] When competition is viewed as a process, high profits once again have the potential to be welfare enhancing by increasing the rate of innovation and rewarding entrepreneurial risk taking. A prominent debate in competition economics and antitrust has centered on whether firms that face more competition or have more market power have greater incentives to innovate. On the one hand, Kenneth Arrow developed his “replacement effect” theory, which finds that firms closer-facing competitive conditions have greater innovation incentives. [53] Schumpeter is often read as arguing that firms with greater market power will innovate more, since they can appropriate the gains from this innovation given their insulated market position. Indeed, firms may not enter a market at all if profits are not appropriable. Schumpeter thus improves upon Smith to show that market power actually drives long-run dynamic efficiency, which increases growth and social welfare. Although much work has focused on this “Arrow-Schumpeter” debate about what market structures are most conducive to innovation, the most fundamental insight from Schumpeter about market structure is the fact that large firms that take advantage of scale are not evidence that competition is absent, but rather just the opposite. It is not only that firms with market power can have greater incentives to innovate, but also that innovation can be the very cause of both greater market concentration and greater economic welfare at the same time. David Teece has noted that “innovation drives competition as assuredly as competition drives innovation.” [54] Often, what seem to be monopolistic practices (i.e., practices that seem to restrict output at the expense of consumers) help finance new investment. [55] Empirical evidence points toward an “inverted U”-shaped curve whereby concentrated industries engage in more innovation but start to engage in less as they come closer to monopoly status. [56] Many other studies have looked into the empirical evidence of whether firms with more market power invest more significantly in R&D. [57] According to recent research on dominant “Big Tech” platforms, it does seem to be the case that these firms invest in R&D at a greater pace relative to other firms. [58] From the viewpoint of creative destruction, firms compete dynamically by introducing new products and processes that threaten the viability of established business models. But it is also important to note that innovation also occurs when incumbents improve on existing products. Innovating through enhancing quality or new variety is a large driver of economic growth, as recent research shows. [59] Rather than being purely economic, profit-maximizing actors, entrepreneurs for Schumpeter are an elite group driven by a heroic entrepreneurial spirit. [60] For Schumpeter, entrepreneurs engage in the investment and discovery of new commodities and production methods, opening new markets, and finding new sources of supply. [61] Schumpeter’s connection of large capitalist enterprises as a primary source of innovation and, in turn, his connection with innovation as a primary driver of increased average standards of living, led him to view the entrepreneur as a character of primary importance in the market system. The entrepreneur’s role is not simply efficient or profit-maximizing, but heroic. [62] By pursuing the spectacular rewards that the market offers successful innovators, capitalist managers drive new forms of competition and economic growth. [63] Although Schumpeter’s conception of creative destruction and the connection of innovation with economic growth helped save the analysis of the private enterprise system, he also analyzed the capitalist system from many points of view besides the purely economic, including the historical, managerial, and philosophical. For instance, his economic analysis of dynamic competition influenced his analysis of the morality of economic growth, as can be seen by his claim that, “The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort.” [64] However, it also influenced Schumpeter’s thinking on the long-run viability of capitalism. He saw in it the seeds of its own destruction emanating from an elite managerial class that, once vibrant, innovative, and full of entrepreneurial spirit, becomes decadent and bureaucratic, undermining the very values necessary to keep the system going. [65] Like Hayek, Schumpeter viewed competition as taking place in a world of constant economic change, but he conceived the nature of this change differently. He agreed that “capitalism … never can be stationary,” but averred that “the fundamental impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.” [66] Therefore, he argued that the source of change is not only the underlying data of the market that manifest in market prices, as emphasized by Hayek, but also the introduction of new forms of competition by capitalist enterprises. In other words, as opposed to Hayek’s price-centric conception of competition, the core dimensionality of competition for Schumpeter was innovation . For Hayek, competition was only desirable because we do not know who will produce most efficiently or innovate more. It would make little sense to allow competition between various producers if these outcomes were predetermined and in fact would be wasteful. [67] Schumpeter corroborated this in his discussion of competition through innovation. The market is continuously disrupted and thrown into disequilibrium by the introduction of altogether new methods of serving consumers. [68] For both thinkers, capitalism—economic competition under the institutions of private property—increases economic growth by rewarding producers who discover new business models that increase social welfare. Yet, a fundamental difference that creates tension between them on dynamic competition is their views on the “knowledge problem”—on the possibility of centrally planning economic activity in the absence of market prices. While Hayek took the view that socialist central planning was theoretically impossible due to the dispersed nature of the knowledge required to make rational economic decisions, Schumpeter believed such planning was not impossible, but would result in an economic system that no longer permits large profits and rewards for innovation. Thus, planning portends stagnation. Hayek and Schumpeter were both frustrated by economists’ reliance on the model of perfect competition, and both dismantled the case for using it as a standard for the performance of capitalist enterprise. Contrary to perfect competition, large market shares and persistently high profit levels are not prima facie evidence of harm to competition. In fact, they are likely to be just the opposite when dynamically competitive forces are present. Examining the exact structure of an industry is unimportant, or at least of secondary importance for both Schumpeter and Hayek. From the standpoint of both thinkers, competition policy that worries strictly about concentration is apt to reduce efficiency and innovation. New large, integrated forms of economic organization that can exploit technology in order to succeed before unattainable economies of scale are part of the process of discovering the methods of competition that best serve customers and boost productivity. Furthermore, it is these market structures that are apt to engage in growth-enhancing innovation and challenge one another. They are therefore seen as not only unproblematic in a world of imperfect information but also a positive force for progress concerning long-term growth. Their differing views on the knowledge problem may partially account for Schumpeter’s sanguine outlook about the capabilities of large enterprises to plan economic activity. Hayek viewed the potential of planning by any entity as necessarily limited by the knowledge problem and feared the misallocation of monopoly even though he viewed such misallocation as primarily the creation of government restrictions and intervention. However, neither placed an efficiency limit on how large an enterprise can become. In fact, Hayek asserted that bigness can be the most effective challenge to incumbent monopoly. It may well be that, say, in the electrical industry of one country, no other corporation has the strength or the staying power to “take on” an established giant intent upon defending its de facto monopoly of some of the products. But as the development of the great automobile or chemical concerns in the USA shows, they have no compunction about encroaching on such fields in which the backing of large resources is essential to make the prospects of entry promising. Size has thus become the most effective antidote to the power of size. [69] This adds another layer to Schumpeterian competition. Not only do larger firms have greater incentives to innovate, but scale is required to encroach on the territory of other established giants as well. The potential of entry of a large firm not currently in the field can keep apparent monopolies in check and push them to continue innovating. Furthermore, competition through the introduction of new products or methods of production is essential when technology is changing, leaving the door open for competitors to “leapfrog” incumbents. [70] In this environment, firms that wish to have a lasting presence must often make their own profitable products or services obsolete by innovating, or risk losing ground to rivals. The departure on the knowledge problem influences differing views on the role of the entrepreneur. For instance, during periods of waning creative destruction, Schumpeter had no problem in believing that the economy moved back in the direction of perfect competition. Kirzner believes the success of new innovations proves that the market was before in disequilibrium, and that innovative entrepreneurs are alert to these profit opportunities. Kirzner’s entrepreneurship is stripped down to the concept of “alertness.” Entrepreneurs are alert to profit opportunities and capitalize on them. For Schumpeter, alertness wasn’t enough. Entrepreneurs innovate and engage in creative destruction. For Hayek and Kirzner, the institutions of the market and the price system drive entrepreneurs to exploit profit opportunities and innovate, but Schumpeter’s more romantic vision of entrepreneurship led him to believe that successful large firms would lose their edge and bring about the downfall of the very system that had enriched them. Hayek’s entrepreneur as an alert arbitrageur responding to incentives provided by the market that are unseen by others contrasts with the heroic entrepreneur of Schumpeter. Hayek’s entrepreneur responds to the rules and norms of just conduct set forth by social and political institutions, but Schumpeter’s entrepreneur works outside of them as a creative hero. Schumpeter believed that economic growth spurred by capitalism would routinize innovation and obviate the function of the heroic entrepreneur, thereby eroding the values requisite for maintaining the capitalist system itself. Hayek’s vision of entrepreneurship was more purely economic and left the role of moral values as part of the set of social institutions that determine entrepreneurial discovery. Both theories together provide a more enlightened conception of economic competition as a dynamic process. Some economists are developing metrics, such as measures of reallocation and dynamism, and new models that are consistent with both conceptions of the entrepreneur. [71] While the entrepreneur of Kirzner and Hayek is an equilibrating force in a world of disequilibrium, Schumpeter’s entrepreneur is a disequilibrating force disrupting current trends toward equilibrium through disruptive innovation. Kirzner’s entrepreneur exploits the opportunities in disequilibrium to move prices further toward what an equilibrium state would achieve, thereby increasing allocative efficiency. Schumpeterian entrepreneurs continually throw the economy into disequilibrium by introducing new innovations into the market. While this report is not intended to cover all important implications of dynamic competition for antitrust enforcement and competition policy, some implications that have been made clear are listed ahead. Competition in the modern American economy is a dynamic process. Static models of competition evaluate economic outcomes from a single point in time and depict a world in which rivalry is absent. The static approach to competition is more relevant to industries that are stagnant, that grow very little, or in which competitors have few dynamic capabilities. The more an industry is characterized by innovation competition, the more salient a dynamic approach to competition becomes. Using a static model, persistently high profits are a troublesome sign of extraction from consumers. Under the dynamic approach, such profits are the returns from innovation that in turn allow firms to continue to innovate through investment and R&D. The dynamic process approach accepts that entrepreneurs operate in a world of fundamental uncertainty, which implies that market positions are always tenuous. This uncertainty is the reason market competition is beneficial to consumers, because it allows the market to assign greater rewards to the producers that emerge to serve consumer needs and desires most effectively. While the Chicago school approach focused too heavily on equilibrium outcomes, the modern Neo-Brandeisian movement focuses too much on concentration as a superficial indicator of market power. Dynamic competition sees neither equilibrium nor concentration as dispositive, but views conduct in the context of the process of market competition over time and its effects on incentives to innovate. In markets where innovation is a persistent factor, it should be recognized that potential competition disciplines incumbents, even if they are large, dominant firms. Large firms must balance the advantages of scale with the need to stay nimble enough to innovate and adapt to new technological advances. Otherwise, more nimble competitors in the wings will leapfrog these incumbents by creating new products that make the old obsolete. Leapfrogging occurs when new innovators, rather than competing on the margins with established firms, introduce new products and services that make incumbents obsolete. A concrete example would be the dangers posed to Google, an established firm in online general search, by the introduction of large language models by firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Due to its previous successes innovating, it can try to adapt and introduce new AI tools into its existing products and otherwise attempt to adapt to the changing landscape and avoid being leapfrogged by these smaller rivals. Bigness is not necessarily harmful. On the contrary, the scale of large enterprises enables mass production and lower costs to consumers. This is particularly prevalent in innovation industries, where network effects and scale economies are often present. [72] More importantly, larger firms have the capabilities and incentives to engage in an outsize amount of R&D spending and are more likely to innovate and drive economic growth, both through incremental innovation as well as the process of creative destruction. [73] Successful firms that have been content to rest on their laurels and refrain from investing in new technologies for fear of cannibalizing their existing products have been overtaken by other firms. Creative destruction provides a built-in incentive for large firms to continue innovating. Moreover, large firms present the biggest competitive challenges to one another, as scale is required to challenge firms with a dominant position in an innovation industry. [74] Mergers that increase concentration can be an entrepreneurial method of better serving customers and cutting costs by combining resources, technical know-how, and intangible assets. Even though mergers and concentration in general reduce the number of rivals in a market, the gains to welfare and innovation can outweigh the lost competition. Structural presumptions in merger enforcement are likely to reduce economic efficiency and innovation. In fact, enforcers should be more willing to view blocking a merger as blocking the entry of a new competitor—the merged firm—instead of simply the subtraction of a competitor from the market. [75] It may be worth preventing this competitor from existing, but enforcers should be clear on why this is the case. The goal of antitrust is not maximum rivalry, but rather the prevention of anticompetitive conduct that reduces the benefits society receives from trade and commerce. [76] According to the dynamic competition approach, antitrust policy should be less concerned with market shares as an indicator of competitive conditions. Additionally, so-called “killer acquisitions” also contribute to the entry of new innovation as more nimble startups that create new products and know-how that can be acquired by larger firms with the capabilities to scale them quickly. Entrepreneurs have too limited a role in static models of competition. However, entrepreneurial firms, which can be any size, are the drivers of the dynamic competitive process because they are alert to profit opportunities and introduce new innovations that disrupt markets. This process increases economic growth because innovation and technological advancements increase productivity and wealth. Misguided antitrust policies can channel entrepreneurial activity toward exploiting socially malignant profit opportunities. Indeed, antitrust actions have often been brought by competitors seeking to gain leverage over a more successful rival. [77] Rather than focusing solely on high profits over time for certain firms, antitrust should examine whether such firms are driven to innovate by Schumpeterian competition or earn high profits without intensive investment in new R&D and innovation. A firm that fits the latter description is more problematic from an antitrust perspective and unlikely to be driven by an entrepreneurial spirit. Each of these implications indicates a Schumpeterian, dynamic approach to competition that better aligns with market realities in innovation industries. An explicitly formulated dynamic approach will be an important component of a competition policy that supports and promotes innovation, progress, and continued leadership at the frontier of global technological advancement. While the neo-Brandeisians paid lip-service to the process of competition, they left analysis of the process largely unformulated and employed a structural viewpoint that was replaced by new economic learning decades ago. Antitrust can further advance by incorporating the dynamic approach that—while also grounded in economics—takes a process view of competition and is much more concerned about innovation than the static approach, which assesses welfare impacts from a particular point in time. The dynamic paradigm is not new and is inspired by the work of 20th century economists. Nonetheless, it has been fully integrated into U.S. antitrust policy and is lacking even further in other antitrust jurisdictions, such as the EU. Notably, Schumpeter and Hayek analyzed market competition as a dynamic process in which market participants must continuously adjust to constant change. This report argues that, while debates about who is the most theoretically “correct” continues to be played out in academic journals, both views can be used together to inform competition policy by providing deeper understanding of the behavior of firms, with particular emphasis on firms in highly dynamic sectors, such as technology. The dynamic competition approach has significant implications for competition policy, and new insights continue to be developed in a vibrant and active research program.

Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization (4th ed . , Pearson-Addison Wesley, 2005) or any standard mircroeconomics textbook, such as Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok, Modern Principles of Microeconomics (5th ed., Worth Publishers, 2021). [14] . More precisely, the concern is that price will exceed marginal cost. In static competition markets, prices should be pushed down toward the marginal costs of production, or the cost of producing additional units of the product. A typical problem in innovation industries is that overhead (fixed) costs are very high and the marginal costs of production are very low, even zero. To cover fixed costs, therefore, price must exceed marginal cost and may look supra-competitive from a static point of view. Additionally, it can be difficult to observe marginal cost, so average costs can be used as a substitute. Average cost is the total cost of producing all units divided by the number of units of a product. Where marginal cost is zero, the average cost will be equal only to fixed costs divided by the number of units. [15] . For an erudite explanation of the difference between dynamic theory and analyzing competition as a process, it is worth quoting Schumpeter at length: “It should be observed that the defining feature of dynamic theory has nothing to do with the nature of economic reality to which it is applied. It is a general method of analysis rather than the study of a particular process. We can use it in order to analyze a stationary economy, just as an evolving one can be analyzed by means of the methods of statics (“comparative statics”). Hence dynamic theory need not take, and as a matter of fact has not taken, any special cognizance of the process of creative destruction which we have taken to be the essence of capitalism. It is no doubt better equipped than is static theory to deal with many questions of mechanism that arise in the analysis of that process. But it is not an analysis of that process itself, and it treats the resulting individual disturbances of given states and structures just as it treats other disturbances. To judge the functioning of perfect competition from the standpoint of capitalist evolution is therefore not the same thing as judging it from the standpoint of dynamic theory.” Joseph A.

Europe’s Interoperability Push Undermines Western Tech Leadership,2025-10-10,Hadi Houalla; Hilal Aka,"Many successful tech firms rely on closed, integrated ecosystems that limit third-party access to preserve consistent performance, user privacy, and device security. With its Digital Markets Act , the European Commission has mandated a different approach by requiring a small number of designated “gatekeepers,” the vast majority of which are American, to open up their platforms to third parties. But the EU’s interoperability requirements do not just create heavy engineering burdens on firms and distort investment into new features, they also directly harm European consumers by forcing companies like Apple to weaken its security and withhold innovative new features in the single market. The DMA imposes numerous interoperability obligations on service providers, which the EU has framed as necessary to ensure “all developers have an effective and predictable path to interoperability and are enabled to innovate.” Notably, Article 6(7) sets out specific obligations for ensuring “effective interoperability”—a tenuous standard in practice which, as ITIF has argued , is not limited to protecting as-efficient competitors and the EU is enforcing in a way akin to public utility regulation rather than more “light touch” conduct-focused rules. In addition to interoperability, the DMA's Article 6(4) also requires gatekeepers to allow sideloading applications and Article 5(4) bans gatekeepers from restricting business users from steering customers to other platforms or payment options. The EU’s DMA interoperability regime is already imposing a heavy cost. Specifically, the DMA’s interoperability rules broadly require Apple to give third-party developers the same level of access to core iOS software features that Apple’s own apps and services enjoy. As such, Apple is being forced to gut the seamless and secure ecosystem that it has built and optimized internally for years. Not only does this increase the number of external developers with deep system access to iOS, creating privacy and security risks, but it also reduces Apple’s incentive and ability to roll out new features. Indeed, the introduction of Apple Intelligence, the company’s new suite of on-device AI tools, was already delayed in Europe , signaling a new normal in which European consumers may receive major technological innovations later than the rest of the world. The interoperability provisions also reach into Apple’s hardware ecosystem, posing yet another set of important risks to security and privacy that will be passed on to consumers in the form of reduced innovation. For example, the European Commission’s interoperability rules for connected devices limit Apple’s ability to roll out new features without having to effectively white-label them for third-party connected device rivals. Unsurprisingly, this has had a chilling effect on Apple’s European release of Live Translation for AirPods, a new feature that synchronizes audio between the earbuds and the iPhone in real time. Delivering Live Translation to third-party earbuds requires opening low-level audio and pairing controls that currently keep user data secure, and doing so risks compromising conversation data. Unfortunately, the new normal for European consumers is clear: delayed or stifled innovation for reduced privacy and security. In addition to the interoperability requirements, the EU is using other parts of the DMA to tear down Apple’s “walled garden.” For example, anti-steering provisions require Apple to allow developers to direct users to external payment channels, bypassing the App Store’s vetted transaction system—dismantling the secure payment architecture that has long protected users from fraud and unauthorized data collection. Moreover, sideloading rules force Apple to permit alternative app stores and direct app downloads outside its established review process. As Apple has pointed out , this change has not only created a more fragmented user experience, but enabled the distribution of apps that circumvent local laws, such as gambling applications in jurisdictions where gambling is illegal. Rather than protect consumers, the DMA is introducing new vectors for fraud and illegal content. To be sure, this undermining of American tech companies under the DMA is no accident; EU policymakers deliberately calibrated the DMA’s gatekeeper thresholds to capture leading American tech companies while exempting European competitors (only later was one European company, Booking.com, designated). Indeed, DMA rapporteur Andreas Schwab expressly stated that the regulation should focus on the “top five” rather than include European firms to “appease the United States.” This discriminatory approach underscores how the EU is using digital regulations like the DMA for protectionist economic reasons rather than to promote consumer welfare. Indeed, the DMA’s interoperability mandates are discriminatory in both design and effect. For American gatekeepers, these obligations impose steep compliance costs, force the disclosure of proprietary technology, and delay product rollouts. This undermines not only U.S. but broader Western technological leadership because it creates opportunities primarily for Chinese rivals to free ride off the DMA and close the global technological gap. The Trump administration has made clear it will not tolerate such measures , and with good reason: when regulations target U.S. companies, they cease to be neutral competition policy and become non-tariff trade barriers. If Brussels continues down this path, the result will be not only weaker Western competitiveness but also escalating transatlantic trade frictions—damaging EU-U.S. relations while the United States reconsiders its trade policies. The DMA’s current approach is not a balanced competition policy, but rather a set of overbroad, discriminatory mandates that impose disproportionate burdens on American firms, weaken Western technological leadership, and risk deepening trade frictions at a moment when transatlantic cooperation is crucial. Promoting competition and expanding opportunities for developers are worthwhile goals, but they should be pursued through collaborative frameworks that provide the utmost respect for privacy, security, and technical feasibility, rather than be imposed through heavy-handed regulations like the DMA. Otherwise, the EU’s course risks undermining not just innovation, but also the collective ability of the West to maintain its technological edge against strategic rivals such as China.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/10/europes-interoperability-push-undermines-western-tech-leadership/
Letter to the Prime Minister and National Assembly of Vietnam Regarding the Proposed Law on Digital Transformation Endnotes,2025-10-12,Joseph V. Coniglio,"His Excellency Tran Thanh Man Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam His Excellency Pham Minh Chinh Prime Minister of Vietnam Your Excellencies: On behalf of the Information Technology and innovation Foundation (ITIF), the world’s top-ranked science and technology policy think tank, I appreciate the opportunity to respectfully submit this comment letter on Vietnam’s proposed Law on Digital Transformation (Draft Law). While ITIF commends Vietnam’s commitment to digital transformation as well as strengthening economic and technology ties with the United States, we are concerned that the Draft Law, if enacted, may inadvertently harm Vietnamese consumers, stifle digital innovation, and complicate bilateral trade relations between the United States and Vietnam to the detriment of both nations. Vietnam’s Draft Law embodies a form of ex ante regulation that would place considerable obligations and constraints on certain large digital firms. Specifically, the law would impose responsibilities upon large-scale and very large-scale digital platforms that include establishing processes to respond to user complaints, as well as obligations related to algorithmic transparency. Moreover, a series of additional responsibilities is contemplated for very large-scale digital platforms, such as annual reports to the Ministry of Science and Technology, along with an extensive number of behavioral restrictions like, for example, limitations on commonplace digital practices like self-preferencing. Ex ante regulation of this kind should be a means to counteract digital market failures that cannot be addressed by enforcing Vietnam’s existing competition laws. However, Vietnam’s digital transformation is nascent and advancing-not a failed project. For example, in 2024, Vietnam’s e-commerce market hit $25 billion-a 20 percent increase from the previous year-amounting to nearly a tenth of the nation’s total retail sales and services revenue. [1] lndeed, not only is Vietnam’s digital sector rapidly growing, but a recent report projected that by 2040, artificial intelligence could add up to $130 billion to Vietnam’s economy. [2] Furthermore, Vietnam does not have an antiquated antitrust regime that has proved unable to police anticompetitive practices in digital markets. On the contrary, Vietnam has not only rather recently enacted a new and more rigorous competition law that includes additional liability for abuses of dominance but appears to have pursued relatively few investigations or enforcement actions in the digital space. As such, before pursuing heavy-handed and cosdy ex ante regulation, Vietnam should seek to first fully utilize its existing competition tools to investigate and, if appropriate, combat any anticompetitive conduct in the digital sphere. ln addition to being unnecessary to correct digital market failures, the Draft Law is likely to stifle the very competition and innovation it seeks to foster. ln particular, the Draft Law appears to categorically ban very large-scale digital platforms from engaging in conduct that is often procompetitive. For instance, the Draft Law appears to proscribe self-preferencing, which is a ubiquitous practice in the digital economy that regularly benefits consumers with more integrated services. Similarly, the Draft Law seems to require large-scale digital platforms to open up their platforms to third-party rivals, which can enable free-riding and chill innovation. Enforcement of the European Union’s similarly structured Digital Markets Act (DMA) has only confirmed the harms that such ex ante digital regulation can bring. For example, with respect to self-preferencing, the DMA’s requirement that Google de-integrate its search and maps services has not only led to a demonstrably worse user experience, but also diverted traffic away from what are often small businesses, like restaurants and hotels, and toward large intermediary competitors. [3] Similarly, due to interoperability requirements, Apple has had to delay rolling out new innovative features like Apple lntelligence and Live Translation for AirPods. [4] ln addition to these economic harms, the criteria that appear to define a very large-scale platform-having either a dominant position or an average monthly user count in Vietnam exceeding 1O percent of the total population-risk being applied in a way that, like the European Union’s DMA, overwhelmingly burdens U.S. firms while leaving domestic and other foreign competitors comparatively untouched. As the Trump administration has made clear, regulations which target U.S. companies may be subject to heavy scrutiny and ultimately retaliatory measures that could overwhelmingly negate any perceived benefits from regulation. [5] lndeed, to the extent it imposes heavy-handed obligations and requirements in a way that targets U.S. digital platforms, the primary impact of the Draft Law may be to tilt the playing field in favor of Chinese rivals (e.g., TikTok, Alibaba/Lazada, Tencent) rather than empower domestic Vietnamese players-contrary to Vietnam’s goals of both fostering homegrown innovation and deepening its techno-economic partnership with the United States. The long-term consequences of these actions could be significant: lower investment by U.S. digital firms in Vietnam, a less dynamic Vietnamese digital ecosystem, and overall greater Chinese techno-economic dominance in Southeast Asia. At bottom, ex ante digital regulation of the kind proposed in the Draft Law threatens to strain U.S.-Vietnam trade relations at the very time Vietnam is simultaneously seeking tariff relief and expanded U.S. market access. ln fact, in view of its restrictions, the Draft Law may also both run counter to the spirit of Vietnam’s recent course-correction on data policy and its corresponding commitments with the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) to avoid unnecessary data localization requirements, as well as the prospective implementation of the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA), whose objectives include a frictionless and innovative Southeast Asian digital economy. [6] For these reasons, ITIF respectfully submits that Vietnam should reject the Draft Law. The nation’s modernized ex post competition law framework already enables robust enforcement against genuinely anticompetitive conduct in the digital sphere, while the proposed the ex ante rules appear poised to dampen innovation, harm Vietnamese consumers, and create unnecessary tensions in U.S.-Vietnam relations.

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AAM.c3aknrke4 Share article Print article OpenAI’s recent rollout of its new video generator Sora 2 marks a watershed moment in AI. Its ability to generate minutes of hyper-realistic footage from a few lines of text is astonishing, and has raised immediate concerns about truth in politics and journalism. But Sora 2 is rolling out slowly because of its enormous computational demands, which point to an equally pressing question about generative AI itself: What are its true environmental costs? Will video generation make them much worse? The recent launch of the Stargate Project — a US$500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and MGX — to build massive AI data centres in the United States underscores what’s at stake. As companies race to expand computing capacity on this scale, AI’s energy use is set to soar. The debate over AI’s environment impact remains one of the most fraught in tech policy. Depending on what we read, AI is either an ecological crisis in the making or a rounding error in global energy use. As AI moves rapidly into video, clarity on its footprint is more urgent than ever. From one perspective, AI is rapidly becoming a major strain on the world’s energy and water systems. Alex de Vries-Gao, a researcher who has long tracked the electricity use of bitcoin mining, noted in mid-2025 that AI was on track to surpass it . He estimated that AI already accounted for about 20 per cent of global data-center power consumption; this is likely to double by year’s end . According to the International Energy Agency, data centres used up to 1.5 per cent of global electricity consumption last year , with consumption growing four times faster than total global demand. The IEA predicts that data centres will more than double their use by 2030, with AI processing the leading driver of growth. Research cited by MIT’s Technology Review concurs, estimating that by 2028, AI’s power draw could exceed “ all electricity currently used by US data centers ” — enough to power 22 per cent of U.S. households each year. AI’s water use is also striking. Data centres rely on ultra-pure water to keep servers cool and free of impurities. Researchers estimated that training GPT-3 would have used up 700,000 litres of freshwater at Microsoft’s American facilities . They predict that global AI demand could reach four to six billion cubic metres annually by 2027. Hardware turnover adds further strain. A 2023 study found that chip fabrication requires “huge quantities” of ultra-pure water , energy-intensive chemical processes and rare minerals such as cobalt and tantalum. Manufacturing the high-end graphics processing units — the engines that drive AI boom — has a much larger carbon footprint than most consumer electronics. Read more: The importance of critical minerals should not condone their extraction at all costs Generating an image uses the electricity of a microwave running for five seconds, while making a five-second video clip takes up as much as a microwave running for over an hour . The next leap from text and image to high-definition video could dramatically increase AI’s impact. Early testing bears this out — finding that energy use for text-to-video models quadruples when video length doubles. Others see the alarm as overstated. Analysts at the Center for Data Innovation , a technology and policy think tank, argue that many estimates about AI energy use rely on faulty extrapolations . GPU hardware is becoming more efficient each year, and much of the electricity in new data centres will come from renewables. Recent benchmarking puts AI’s footprint in context. Producing a typical chatbot Q&A consumes about 2.9 watt-hours (Wh) — roughly 10 times a Google search . Google recently claimed that a typical Gemini prompt uses only 0.24 Wh and 0.25 mL of water , though independent experts note those numbers omit indirect energy and water used in power generation . Context is key. An hour of high-definition video streaming on Netflix uses roughly 100 times more energy than generating a text response . An AI query’s footprint is tiny, yet data centres now process billions daily, and more demanding video queries are on the horizon. It helps to distinguish between training and use of AI. Training frontier models such as GPT-4 or Claude Opus 3 required thousands of graphics chips running for months , consuming gigawatt-hours of power. Using a model takes up a tiny amount of energy per query, but this happens billions of times a day. Eventually, energy from using AI will likely surpass training. The least visible cost may come from hardware production. Each new generation of chips demands new fabrication lines, heavy mineral inputs and advanced cooling. Italian economist Marcello Ruberti observes that “each upgrade cycle effectively resets the carbon clock ” as fabs rebuild highly purified equipment from scratch. And even if AI models become more efficient, total energy keeps climbing. In economics, this is known as the Jevons paradox : in 19th-century Britain, the consumption of coal increased as the cost of extracting it decreased . As AI researchers have noted, as costs per-query fall, developers are incentivized to find new ways to embed AI into every product . The result is more data centres, chips and total resource use. Is AI an ecological menace or a manageable risk? The truth lies somewhere in between. A single prompt uses negligible energy, but the systems enabling it — vast data centres, constant chip manufacturing, round-the-clock cooling — are reshaping global energy and water patterns. The International Energy Agency’s latest outlook projects that data-centre power demand could reach 1,400 terawatt-hours by 2030 . This is the equivalent of adding several mid-sized countries to the world’s grid. AI will count for a quarter of that growth. Many of the figures circulating about AI energy use are unreliable because AI firms disclose so little . The limited data they release often employ inconsistent metrics or offset accounting that obscures real impacts. One obvious fix would be to mandate disclosure rules: standardized, location-based reporting of the energy and water used to train and operate models. Europe’s Artificial Intelligence Act requires developers of “high-impact” systems to document computation and energy use. Similar measures elsewhere could guide where new data centres are built, favouring regions with abundant renewables and water — this could encourage longer hardware lifecycles instead of annual chip refreshes. Generative AI can help unlock extraordinary creativity and provide real utility. But each “free” image, paragraph or video has hidden material and energy costs. Acknowledging those costs doesn’t mean we need to halt innovation. It means we should demand transparency about how great the environmental cost is, and who pays it, in order to address AI’s environmental impacts. As Sora 2 begins to fill social feeds with highly realistic visuals, the question won’t be whether AI uses more energy than Netflix, but whether we can expand our digital infrastructure responsibly enough to make room for both.

China’s Tech Obsession Is Weighing Down Its Economy,2025-10-10,,"Economics Science and Technology China Every day brings new headlines about Chinese tech. Maybe it’s an electric vehicle with longer-range batteries , an updated artificial intelligence model , or a humanoid robot —but the message is the same every time: China is a tech juggernaut. Some credit China’s economic model . Others believe it’s the engineer-trained leaders and hard-edged entrepreneurs who know how to work the system or the sustained transfer of tacit knowledge from the United States and others. But whatever the cause, China’s continued tech ascent seems unstoppable. Yet equally persuasive are signs of structural weaknesses : rising debt, an aging population, a collapsed real estate market, and rising youth unemployment. China’s economy, some say, has peaked . “ Involution ,” or wasted production, is not only the word of the year in China but for some is another sign of an inescapable downward growth spiral. If this trajectory continues, China will find it impossible to escape the middle-income trap . If China’s economy slows down or stagnates, nearly 1 billion people could be stuck in low-income livelihoods. Every day brings new headlines about Chinese tech.

If this trajectory continues, China will find it impossible to escape the middle-income trap . If China’s economy slows down or stagnates, nearly 1 billion people could be stuck in low-income livelihoods. Observers often favor one or the other of these diametrically opposed images. Some argue that China’s innovation prowess is overstated, while others say the debt and demographic challenges are more manageable than some people assume. Our own view, based on extensive fieldwork in urban and rural China that yielded large amounts of qualitative and quantitative data, is that there is truth in both and that the key challenge is to integrate them into a single, unified vision of the country’s economy. The split screen of techno-wizardry on one side and empty apartment complexes and struggling villages on the other conveys valuable yet only partially accurate pictures of a complex country. One of us previously described China as a “ fat tech dragon ,” generating tech breakthroughs but wasting vast quantities of resources that were never properly metabolized in the Chinese economy. Almost a decade later, China now looks more like a “slow tech dragon,” one weighed down by its own heavy tail defined by a misallocation of resources, low income growth, and neglect. In many cases, both the upward signs and the worrying ones may seem unconnected but are really two sides of the same coin. A seemingly bifurcated picture is still one country, and the roots of both the optimism and the pessimism are the same. Employees work in an electronics factory in Chongqing, in southwestern China, on Sept. 13. AFP via Getty Images By every measure, China’s technology capabilities have improved dramatically in recent decades. From 2010 to 2025, China’s rank in the Global Innovation Index , the gold standard for tech development, rose from 43rd to 10th. China now sits first among 36 upper-middle-income economies and 3rd in the Asia-Pacific, trailing only Singapore and South Korea. China’s spending on research and development jumped 475 percent between 2007 and 2023, placing it just behind the United States. In 2017, China’s scientists for the first time published more papers than their U.S. counterparts. By 2022, their papers also were being cited more often by other scholars. China has long led the world in the number of filed patents but since 2019 has led with the most filings of globally recognized “PCT” patents, an objective sign of quality. In 2015, China launched the infamous “Made in China 2025” plan to accelerate its indigenous capabilities and market share in a wide range of high-tech sectors. Analyses by Bloomberg , the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Rhodium Group , the Wire China , and others show that the risky initiative largely paid off, with substantial advances in domestic technical capabilities, value added, and market share in most of the targeted industries. The focus on innovation has contributed to growth by dint of expanding inputs (extensive growth) and improving the productivity of those inputs, particularly technological upgrading and the strengthening of human capital in urban China. China’s factory labor used to be “cheap”—now it is becoming higher-skilled. Factory workers now do much more than simple, repetitive tasks; they have to act with precision, interact with advanced machinery and processes, and make judgments about quality. Investments in national logistics, electricity, IT infrastructure, and regional tech hubs have provided a foundation and an environment for firms to develop new products and improve their manufacturing processes. Equally important, industrial policy has facilitated spillovers across related industries, allowing progress in one sector to contribute to advances in others. Despite all of this amazing and rapid progress, the high-tech push has not translated into maintaining rapid growth and a stronger macroeconomy. After the boom-boom years of 1980 to 2010, China has seen an uninterrupted 15 years of slowing growth and rising debt—and the tech push is part of the problem. China has made some smart bets, but the political signals from planners have resulted in massive overinvestment in several technologies. China has more than 100 EV makers ; there used to be even more. The number of companies investing in humanoid robots has exploded. While officials have many ways to attract new entrants, they have much more difficulty pushing out bad firms and consolidating sectors. Through easy access to funding (often through local governments) and a weak bankruptcy law, both state-owned and private firms still have soft budget constraints, allowing them to stay afloat long beyond what the market would bear. Although both Chinese and Western media often report on China’s tech successes, industry and product failures are common, costly, and rarely discussed. China’s sweet spot is moderately difficult technologies that can be tweaked and improved incrementally and then sold in massive amounts at low margins. China has had more difficulty in the most complex, advanced technologies where economies of scale are less valuable. Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in investment over several decades, China is still a minor leaguer in commercial aviation, even as domestic air travel has boomed. The regional C909 (formerly the ARJ21) and narrow-body C919 depend almost entirely on Western components. Efforts over the past decade to design a homegrown aircraft engine have yet to bear fruit. China has made some progress in semiconductors , particularly with legacy chips, packaging, and testing, but it is still heavily dependent on the West for advanced chips, chip design software, and manufacturing equipment. China continues to lag others for similar reasons in complex fine chemicals , quantum computing , and high-end precision machining . Of course, the most infamous area where good money has gone after bad is in real estate, which in the past has accounted for as much as 30 percent of the economy. Local governments, starved for cash, leased their land to developers, who went on building binge unprecedented in human history. Historian Vaclav Smil has documented , for example, how China used more cement in three years than the United States used in the entire 20th century. When local governments ran out of money, China’s developers instead started taking deposits from owners even before shovels hit the ground. In the past several years, property prices have tumbled—despite government efforts to prop them up. By one measure , China has more than 60 million empty residential units. Despite the government’s desire to shift growth drivers from infrastructure to tech, the real estate crisis is still dragging down the rest of the economy. A man uses a mobile phone near a construction site in Beijing on May 30, 2014. Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images A key reason success in tech is not translating widely into the macroeconomy is the lack of connectivity to other critical sources of broad-based development, namely China’s massive pool of human capital. China is seeing striking success in frontier technologies such as batteries and solar, but this does not yield rapid economic growth since these industries are relatively small and capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive. As capital has been drawn to priority sectors, investment in areas that might produce greater employment or income growth has been crowded out. For all of China’s prowess in manufacturing and e-commerce in cities, and forestry and mining in the hinterland, China lags far behind in many high-value-added service sectors. Among the most prominent are healthcare and education, labor-intensive sectors that would soak up urban employment and provide services that would strengthen human capital. It is possible that new technologies, once diffused through the economy, could eventually help lift all boats. But standing in the way of this diffusion is the mismatch between the kind of work created by advances in frontier technology, which tends to require higher skill levels, and the skill levels of China’s labor force, which on average are very low. In fact, China has one of the most poorly educated labor forces in the upper-middle-income world. The relatively late expansion of secondary education in China, which only really took off in the 2000s, means that some 60 percent of China’s labor force has not attended even one day of high school. While this will change over time, it will still take decades to achieve the levels that South Korea and Ireland had when they were middle income and striving to move up to high-income status. No country in the world has successfully moved from middle- to high-income status with the low levels of aggregate human capital that China has today. Who are we discussing here? We are not talking about the 400 million reasonably well-educated people that constitute China’s middle class, who by themselves outnumber the population of the United States and dominate the modern media image of China. We are also not talking about those in dire poverty—this segment of the population is now only a small fraction of what it was 30 years ago. According to the calculations of China’s State Council, there is no one under the nation’s poverty line. Rather, we are talking about, as China’s former Premier Li Keqiang reminded , the 900 million people who are living on about $10 a day, often in the thousands and tens of thousands of small cities and rural townships and villages in China’s interior. They have poor levels of education and health and have little or no access to long-term job security, benefits, or savings.

Uneven employment among this huge part of the labor force could, most simply, crowd out growth in high-tech sectors. In an advanced economy, a large part of the labor force needs to know math, science, how to use computers, and have language skills to find gainful employment and contribute to growth. In the past, China’s labor force did not need to be highly educated because workers were engaged in labor-intensive manufacturing and construction. But as countries approach high-income status, not only does the share of labor in manufacturing and construction fall, but the demands on the labor force in all sectors rise sharply. White-collar jobs replace blue-collar ones, and it is imperative that the labor force is well educated, with the skills needed in a high-skill/high-wage economy, so that large shares of the once blue-collar workers can now begin to work in offices and contribute to keeping the economy from falling into the middle-income trap. This is where the Chinese economy’s demand for a skilled labor force is almost certainly going to run into the reality of China’s massive poorly educated bloc of workers. In simplest terms, a large portion of China’s 600 million rural workers will not be able to upgrade into an expanding number of white-collar jobs. They are the part of the labor force that made it through junior high school—for the most part—and they simply will not be able to compete with their better-educated (and mostly urban) peers. A high-income China will still need a large number of blue-collar workers, but it will not need 300 million to 400 million of them. Take the uneven spread of e-commerce businesses in China. Entrepreneurs leveraging e-commerce to sell goods or launch businesses abound in China’s big cities, where the educated classes are clustered. Many of these businesses fail, but some launch small entrepreneurs into bigger leagues. E-commerce platforms have been heralded as a means of linking rural goods with urban consumers, offering an economic lifeline for underemployed rural communities.

Jade Gao/AFP via Getty Images But research has shown that only the most educated or wealthy populations in rural areas (often urban individuals coming out into the countryside) can take advantage of the platforms. The vast majority of rural people simply do not have the skills or knowhow to take advantage of this new moneymaking opportunity. Indeed, this is an example of how China’s human capital shortfall could leave hundreds of millions of people unable to capitalize on a modern economy. So, what will these people do? They are being squeezed out of manufacturing, and after the collapse of the real estate bubble, huge numbers of rural workers are no longer needed for construction. Most fundamentally, many in China’s labor force cannot compete in the skilled jobs of the future. Many have moved into the gig economy, driving rideshare or delivery vehicles, or have joined other informal sectors in such numbers that wages and working conditions may even be falling. Over the past 15 years, the share of China’s labor force in the informal economy has risen from some 40 to 60 percent . Others might have no option but to go back to the farmland owned by their families —even though most young rural workers (under 35 to 40 years old) have never farmed, do not know how to farm, and do not want to farm. Most importantly, considering the nation’s future development, in any of these scenarios their contributions to growth are minimal: They have low income, low or no benefits, and low job security. In short, many of those in the rural labor force may not be able to help themselves, are unlikely to consume much, and are poorly positioned to help China grasp “new quality productive forces,” in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s words. The strength of an economy is typically measured in physical attributes, but the attitudes of households, workers, and consumers also matter. Interviews and survey data show that over the past several years, a deep sense of uncertainty and worry has come to grip many Chinese and foreigners who do business with the country. From top to bottom, among both Chinese and foreigners, there is a crisis of confidence about China’s trajectory. For the past three years, multinationals and global institutional investors have debated the question “Is China investible?” Fears about China’s statist policy orientation, the economic slowdown, and hardening tensions with the United States have led many, though far from all, to answer in the negative. The domestic conversation in China does not use the same language, but the anxieties are not that different. Pedestrians peruse small shops on a crowded street in Changsha, in China’s Hunan province, on Sept. 7, 2020. Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images Multiple executives from China’s private companies have told us that they are holding back investment because they do not expect a strong recovery in domestic demand. All they need to do is cite China’s consumer confidence index , which nosedived in April 2022, when Shanghai went into lockdown as COVID-19 swept through the city, and has flatlined since. Such pessimism reflects a historic shift. Recent research by Martin King Whyte, Michael Alisky, and one of us clearly shows that there has been a fundamental decline in the level of optimism about the economy across China’s population. A nationally representative survey in 2014 revealed that a large majority of people in China—including those who were below the median level of income—believed they were better off than they were five years earlier and that they would continue to be better off five years into the future. In the 2014 survey, low-income respondents tended to blame their own shortcomings rather than any systemic problem with China’s economy. But in 2023, the same survey revealed the opposite: Sharply fewer respondents reported having improved prospects compared with the previous five years, and most poorer people blamed the economy rather than themselves for their low levels of income. These conflicting elements are visible everywhere you look in China. Take the city of Changzhou, in the heart of the manufacturing powerhouse of Jiangsu and an hour northwest of Shanghai by high-speed rail. The city is home to a growing number of EV battery-makers, including Svolt, which has a stunningly modern manufacturing facility that is 95 percent automated. Svolt batteries have gradually increased in density and driving range, and the company provides them to several major automakers, including Great Wall, Leap, and Geely. Svolt has nine other facilities around the country and a factory in Thailand. Yang Hongxin, Svolt’s young CEO, gave one of us a data-rich presentation that revealed how far the company had come and the path it needs to follow to remain competitive. But at the same time, when one of us visited the Svolt headquarters, worrying signs were easy to find. Svolt ranks fifth in China’s highly crowded battery market, and with supply far outpacing demand, the debt load to carry massive inventories is substantial. The company’s automated factories are impressive but create relatively few jobs. A nearby shopping mall had fancy-looking stores and displayed the latest models from Li Auto, but there were few shoppers. Across the road was a large residential compound with more than a dozen high-rise apartment buildings that, according to one contact, sat empty. This combination of strengths and weaknesses could describe hundreds of Chinese cities. Equally, visits to EV giant BYD’s Shenzhen headquarters in May 2018 and July 2025 revealed huge advances in battery chemistry, density, and safety and the range and design of BYD cars. BYD boasts not only super inexpensive models but also luxury lines that are challenging Audi and BMW for market share. BYD has highly advanced labs to study acoustics and radiation and a crash test facility that has been certified by regulators around the world. At the same time, Shenzhen, the iconic city of China’s manufacturing boom, reflects the economy’s strains. The slowdown in domestic demand and growing international tensions have forced many companies to fold and workers to lose their jobs. Even those doing relatively well are struggling in many respects. BYD now has almost 28 percent of China’s EV market and more than 22 percent of the global market —double that of Tesla!—but its debt levels have also risen dramatically. In 2025, shopping malls that one of us visited in the city were half-empty, with more lookers than buyers; restaurants suffered from lots of open tables. The only growing class of consumers are Hong Kongers who ride the high-speed rail up to Shenzhen on weekends looking for bargains. Or consider villages in the south of Shaanxi province. Repeated field trips over the last three decades showed that between the early 1990s and the mid-2010s, the income of households went up, driven mostly by remittances from family members who had emigrated. Today, through interactions with the families that we have been in contact with for decades, we know that many young people do not make enough to maintain their own low-level standard of living. Young rural workers are sharing jobs, living in small rooms with many other migrants, and jumping from job to job to job, all in the informal economy. Because of this, many older people are barely getting by. The average age of a male farmer in a rural village is more than 60 years old. At a time when urbanites are retiring, rural older people are still working, struggling to make ends meet, trying to save every penny because of the risk that is in their future. And this certainly means they are keeping consumption to as low a level as possible.

China Has Become Powerful Before It Is Rich By placing power above plenty too soon, Xi Jinping may have made a great strategic blunder. Analysis | Jo Inge Bekkevold China’s tech success and macroeconomic malaise are linked. The system is tilted strongly in favor of industry and technology relative to households and consumers. While state-direct financial institutions have funneled trillions of dollars to priority projects and business, the country’s wages are low , the social safety net is underdeveloped , and household investment options are far and few between. Homes have ceased to be a store of value, and the stock market, while currently on an upswing, has been flat over the past decade and a half and has yet to prove itself as a pathway to greater wealth. The tilted playing field, with all of the waste, means a monumental misallocation of resources. While Chinese firms can tout new tech breakthroughs, in study after study , both by scholars and international institutions , it can be shown that productivity growth has slowed and contributed much less to overall GDP growth than in the past. Some, such as scholar Jean Oi and her co-authors , believe that the funneling of resources to industry and tech represents an essential “guns or butter” trade-off, that China has finite financial resources—with debt levels around 300 percent of GDP—and hence faces a zero-sum choice between pursuing technological preeminence and consumer-driven growth. There may be something to this, but it is just as likely that policymakers have decided to put their eggs in the tech basket and for a variety of reasons and are hesitant to take substantial steps to support workers and consumers. This may be the product of a pro-tech materialist ideology and a belief that too much support for workers would make them lazy. It may also be motivated by worsening international tensions in which China’s traditional technology suppliers in the West have made it clear that they will not be reliable suppliers going forward. Regardless, this does appear to us as a question of policy choice and political will, not finite resource constraints. If authorities in China wanted to address the sources of low productivity in the economy, they could still support high-tech sectors but would need to take other steps to resolve both the short- and long-run challenges faced by millions of low-income Chinese. First, there is a great need for unemployment insurance for rural workers. Currently, rural workers are not eligible for unemployment insurance because, in the view of state planners, they can always go back “home” and farm—even though this is not realistic for most. Further weakening hukou (residency) restrictions—allowing rural people to move into cities of all levels to get access to higher-quality housing, schooling, health care, and social security—would almost certainly help low-income people upgrade over time. And leaning into several direct approaches to boosting human capital would pay dividends, including upscaling early childhood development programs, improving the quality of preschools and primary schools, and making academic high school (versus vocational high school) available to all who want to attend. Of course, all of these initiatives are expensive, and China’s fiscal constraints are not entirely mythical. Residents of China’s big cities who have enjoyed preferential access to services and opportunity for decades may be reluctant to share. But we believe such efforts are absolutely necessary for the expansion of a healthy economy in the short, medium and long run. If done properly, they will pay for themselves in time as the investments grow China’s economic pie. Employees work on an electric vehicle production line at a factory of the Chinese automaker NIO in Hefei, in China’s Anhui province, on Sept. 24. Jade Gao/AFP via Getty Images Regardless of which path China pursues, the United States and others will face challenging circumstances. If China continues to lean entirely in the direction of “new quality productive forces” and remains a slow tech dragon, it will continue to make real breakthroughs in tech, but the weaknesses of human capital and domestic demand will exacerbate existing imbalances at home and abroad. In turn, that will produce further polarization between the winners and losers in the domestic economy and between China and other countries whose technology-oriented sectors will come under greater threat from China’s exports. Under such circumstances, the pressures for others to de-risk or even decouple from China will only grow. And, of course, one can easily imagine China responding by using its own carrots and sticks—far beyond just rare earths—to attack foes and attract supporters. No reform is costless. If China instead sought to address the structural weaknesses in its economy, this would require costly adjustments that would create new winners and losers domestically and painful tensions with them. China’s growth trajectory would be less directly threatening to the tech sectors of other countries, and consumers in China would be better able to absorb more imports—which may be a hard sell for a leadership so strongly focused on self-reliance. Yet, at the same time, an economically reformed China would also have an overall much stronger economy that would make it an even more formidable force on the international stage.

"The War Department’s Spectrum Hoard Endangers National Security DOW Spectrum Is Underused Inefficiency Endangers National Security Be Aggressive, Not Defensive White House Leadership is Key",2025-10-10,Joe Kane,"Insufficient commercial spectrum could soon become a bottleneck to American wireless innovation, security, and leadership. Sufficient spectrum is necessary for everything from Wi-Fi, industrial automation, the space economy, 5G, and, soon, 6G. Congress took a strong step toward easing spectrum bottlenecks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which requires the federal government to find 800 megahertz of spectrum for commercial use. Even after OBBBA, however, the spectrum policy conversation in Washington remains stuck on the defensive, with more concern about what bands to avoid than what to repurpose. While it is reasonable to preserve some incumbent uses, the United States’ spectrum strategy needs to be more than status quo maintenance. This imperative is most important for the Department of War (DOW), which likely controls more spectrum than it needs. Rather than a defensive ethos , in which the DOW fights to protect its current holdings and then drags its feet on implementing a compromise, it should embrace the ways that rapid repurposing of substantial amounts of spectrum for commercial use will enhance the national security, economic growth, and diplomatic power of the United States. The DOW undeniably needs spectrum for critical missions, but its use comes without the discipline of markets . For private spectrum holdings, the profit motive and market prices drive scarce bandwidth toward higher value uses. But DOW spectrum is held outside the market process, and without the feedback loop of the market, there is no signal when federal spectrum holdings are too capacious or inefficient. This lack of big-picture incentives is replicated on the micro level as well. Individuals in federal agencies don’t benefit personally from shrinking their spectrum footprint, so the incentive is to be timid and keep as much spectrum as possible. Add in the rhetorical cudgel of “national security,” and federal spectrum use often escapes political oversight too. In short, the institutional structure of federal spectrum ownership incentivizes inefficiency. Conversely, changing that structure will lead to gains in efficiency. The precise sources of inefficiency are usually classified, meaning internal executive-branch leadership will be essential to making the most of federal airwaves, but we can identify some categories of inefficiency leaders should evaluate and resolve. Some possible sources of inefficiency are geographic; the DOW might use a certain band at a few installations across the country but lay claim to that spectrum band nationwide. This dynamic could produce absurd results in which an Army base in rural New York blocks deployment of advanced commercial communications technologies in Manhattan. DOW should, therefore, be forthright about exactly where it needs each wireless capability and relinquish exclusivity in other areas. Sometimes these barriers are regulatory. Existing rules for commercial use in or near a federal band may be more restrictive than necessary to protect the federal use. In such cases, DOW should volunteer the true maximum commercial use its existing systems could accommodate, enabling greater commercial use while preserving critical DOW applications. Sometimes the issues are technical. The maximum possible commercial use might be too limited because of outdated, poor-performing receivers that are more susceptible to interference and, therefore, prevent entry by advanced commercial systems. In such cases, beyond the need to increase efficiency, DOW should urgently seek to upgrade that equipment, not just to be a good steward of scarce resources, but to mitigate the national security vulnerabilities it engenders. Perversely, DOW and its allies often advocate for the status quo by waving the slogan of “national security.” The reality is that it’s precisely the status quo that endangers national security. Outdated technical equipment that monopolizes too much spectrum isn’t just a matter of efficiency or economic competitiveness. DOW systems with poorly performing receivers are vulnerable to adversaries. These systems are, therefore, a threat not only to the economic and geopolitical benefits of commercial wireless leadership, but also to national security directly. A receiver that is vulnerable to interference from 5G transmissions is even more vulnerable to jamming attacks. And the more important the federal system, the more dangerous these vulnerabilities are. Commercial wireless companies have to follow FCC rules for which bands to use and when. If DOW can’t even function next door to these good actors, what’s the plan for these essential systems when they face attacks by enemies who don’t follow the rules? Opening spectrum to commercial use can be a balm to this vulnerability. When the FCC auctions spectrum licenses in a band previously used by DOW, some of the proceeds can be used to make that band suitable for commercial operations by protecting incumbent operations. In short, commercial spectrum users will pay for the DOW to get better receivers so that the DOW and commercial operations can coexist. That’s a great deal for economic competitiveness and U.S. leadership in wireless ecosystem, but it’s also a great deal for direct national security since DOW systems would get state-of-the-art radios that perform their function better than the old ones. If the DOW is offered more resilient receivers and turns them down, that is the threat to national security, regardless of the commercial implications. The fact that DOW intransigence also blocks American leadership in the next generation of wireless applications is just economic salt in the national security wound. DOW needs to move on from defending every megahertz of spectrum it currently possesses and, instead, be precise about what capabilities it needs to accomplish its missions. It should then gear its spectrum policy toward maintaining and enhancing those capabilities, not the particular system or particular frequencies used to provide it now. This approach will allow DOW to open as much spectrum as possible to commercial use which will, in turn, enhance national security applications. Not only could eventual spectrum auctions directly buy more advanced, secure, and capable equipment, DOW can also take advantage of commercial wireless services themselves. Secure DOW applications running on commercial networks can benefit all parties. Such arrangements also allow DOW to take advantage of large commercial R&D budgets, which enhance the productivity of spectrum and create higher-performing devices. Because these benefits await at the end of a successful implementation of the OBBBA’s spectrum provisions, DOW should be aggressively cooperative, seeking to beat the statutory deadlines and reduce its exclusive spectrum footprint as much as possible. That means studying more than just the bear minimum of spectrum for repurposing. A good start would be rapid study of the 2.7 GHz, 4.4 GHz, and Lower 7 GHz bands. But DOW should do more preliminary work beyond that, for example, the entire 7 GHz band. Even if all this spectrum doesn’t shift to commercial use immediately, working proactively now means the policy process won’t need to go back to square one as conditions change. DOW should also use the most up-to-date and evidence-based modeling methods, making realistic assumptions and accounting for state-of-the-art interference mitigation techniques and sharing mechanisms. In short, DOW should push the frontier of spectrum technology, not being lag behind. This shift in ethos must start from the top. President Trump must insist that the Department of War become higher tech, rather than letting old-fashioned systems and institutional inertia endanger our national security. When President Trump signed the OBBBA, he set the agenda for aggressive American leadership on spectrum. He should demand that the DOW get on board with his vision, not be dragged along kicking and screaming. DOW should be an active collaborator to see how much spectrum can be repurposed for commercial use, not how little. It should be eager to beat the OBBBA’s deadlines and embrace the best evidence and modeling in conducting spectrum studies. The opportunity cost of an inefficient spectrum status quo is less security, less wireless connectivity, and a dwindling role for U.S. diplomatic, technological, and economic leadership. The OBBBA takes a strong step toward reversing this situation, and it is in the interest of the executive branch to join that effort as willing volunteers, rapidly pushing for enhanced spectrum productivity, rather than clinging to today’s less safe, less productive spectrum allocations.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/10/the-war-department-s-spectrum-hoard-endangers-national-security/
Europe shows us what happens when bureaucrats win,2025-10-13,,"Across the Atlantic, freedom lost to red tape. The same disease is creeping into Americaâs tech sector. Americans are accustomed to innovation improving their lives. From smartphones to artificial intelligence , breakthroughs keep coming â and most of them happen in the United States, where freedom fuels invention . But across the Atlantic, the story is very different. Europeâs regulators have built a bureaucracy that smothers creativity. The lesson is simple: Innovation thrives where government steps back, not where it rules from Brussels. Europe doesnât need more commissions or consultations. It needs courage to scrap bad laws and let innovation breathe again. A recent analysis from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation drives home the point. All seven of the worldâs trillion-dollar tech firms are American. Europe can claim only 28 companies worth more than $100 billion. Over the past decade, European firms raised about $426 billion â $800 billion less than their U.S. counterparts. Rather than learn from failure, Brussels tightened its grip â proving again that when regulators fail, they regulate harder. Their Digital Markets Act and Copyright Directive saddle companies with costly mandates that make life harder for both innovators and consumers. EU regulators insist that their rules ensure fairness, transparency, and competition . In reality, theyâre strangling convenience and driving users crazy. Take Google Maps. Because of DMA rules, Europeans can no longer click directly into expanded map views. As one user complained on Reddit, itâs become âa severe pain in the butt.â The new restrictions also hobble tourism. Google Search canât link directly to airlines or hotels, forcing travelers through clunky intermediaries that waste time and money. The Copyright Directive makes things worse. It tells search engines to display only âvery shortâ snippets of news articles â without defining what that means. Bureaucrats promise to judge âthe impact on the effectiveness of the new right,â which means nothing. By contrast, American courts have long recognized that snippets are fair use and help people find what they need. U.S. policy treats information as a public good; the EU treats it as a privilege controlled by the state. The damage goes beyond search results. The EU now forces Apple and other âgatekeepersâ to make their devices interoperable with third-party software â a costly demand that undermines engineering efficiency. Features like iPhone-to-Mac mirroring and real-time translation could disappear from European markets because of it. As Cato Instituteâs Jennifer Huddleston noted , âThe real-time translation feature would be immensely helpful in Europe with so many languages; however, the consequence of European regulation is that it might not be available.â RELATED: Can anyone save America from European-style digital ID? Photo by Lab Ky Mo/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images And when companies donât comply fast enough, Brussels slaps them with massive fines . Apple got hit with 500 million euros (around $580 million), Meta with 200 million euros (around $232 million) â punished not for misconduct but for trying to innovate . The EU now says it will review whether the DMA â achieves its objectives of ensuring contestable and fair digital markets.â Thatâs bureaucratic code for âwe might make it worse.â Meanwhile, the Copyright Directiveâs vague language grows even more dangerous in the age of AI, where machine learning depends on large-scale data use that Brussels canât seem to comprehend. Europe doesnât need more commissions or consultations. It needs courage to scrap bad laws and let innovation breathe again. If Brussels wants to compete with America, it should stop punishing success and start trusting its own entrepreneurs. A lighter-touch approach has worked for the United States â and it could save Europe from technological irrelevance.",,https://www.theblaze.com/columns/opinion/europe-shows-us-what-happens-when-bureaucrats-win
New Research Shows How Strict Data Regulations Undercut Biopharmaceutical R&D The Issue The Evidence and Its Implications Takeaways for U.S. Policymakers,2025-10-10,Sandra Barbosu; Ash Johnson,"Biopharmaceutical innovation depends on access to sensitive data. This data, typically drawn from sources like medical records, clinical trial results, lab research, and genomic studies, is useful to identify new drug targets, validate biomarkers, design clinical trials, and train artificial intelligence (AI) systems that accelerate drug discovery and the development of new therapies. Since this research requires access to such sensitive information, privacy regulations have been implemented to safeguard data, but some of these protections can inadvertently harm medical research. Many times, economic consequences are incidentally imposed through policy constraining how firms collect and use data, reducing the breadth of data supporting the development of new biopharmaceutical innovations (as well as the incentives to do so). In addition to restricting data access, data protection regulations impose compliance costs that require firms to redirect resources toward meeting regulatory requirements, which can shape firms’ strategic choices around research and development (R&D) investments. By contrast, with the right policy support, firms could instead invest in privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) and related infrastructure, enabling compliance while also advancing biopharmaceutical innovation. A new working paper from the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (ETLA) investigates the effect of major data protection laws such as the as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), and Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) on global pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. It finds that the introduction of strict data protection regulations leads to a substantial decline in R&D investments among global pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. Overall decline in R&D spending : Four years after implementation, R&D spending fell by approximately 39 percent relative to pre-regulation levels. Domestic-only firms hit hardest : Companies unable to shift data-sensitive operations abroad saw R&D fall by roughly 63 percent, compared to a 27 percent decline for multinationals. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) disproportionately affected : SMEs reduced R&D spending by about 50 percent vs. 28 percent for larger firms. Therefore, while data protection rules increase costs across the board, the impact is heterogeneous. Multinationals may adjust by relocating data-sensitive operations to jurisdictions with more innovation-friendly rules, but smaller and domestic firms often lack that flexibility. In aggregate, these dynamics translate into fewer novel therapies, as higher compliance costs, project delays, and regulatory complexity lead companies to scale back their R&D programs. The United States does not have comprehensive national-level data protection regulations. Instead, it has multiple sectoral federal laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which places constraints on the collection and use of personal health information. In addition, many states have both comprehensive and sector-specific data protection laws. Overall, the United States has less restrictive regulations compared to some other jurisdictions, but the growing patchwork of laws creates high compliance costs for firms. U.S. policymakers should address this patchwork situation promptly. The U.S. biopharmaceutical industry is the most R&D-intensive industry in the world, investing more than 20 percent of its sales back into R&D each year, employing hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers, and generating broad spillovers across the economy. If overly strict data protection regulations were to push investment abroad or force smaller firms to scale back R&D, U.S. leadership and competitiveness in biopharmaceuticals would be placed at risk. The ETLA findings should not be read as an argument against protecting sensitive health data, but they should serve as a cautionary warning of what happens when policymakers do not consider the unintended consequences of strict data protection laws. Too often, policymakers focus on protecting individual privacy without taking into account the harmful impact of restrictions on data sharing, including the benefits that flow back to individuals and society at large. Policymakers should ensure that data privacy protections advance—rather than inhibit—biopharmaceutical innovation so the United States remains the global leader in life-saving research. To achieve this outcome, U.S. policymakers should pursue the following actions: HIPAA creates unnecessary hurdles to large-scale data collection and sharing essential for medical research. While HIPAA does have several mechanisms to allow data sharing for research purposes, these mechanisms are often insufficient. For example, HIPAA allows sharing de-identified data, but creating simpler rules for doing so could make it easier and less costly for firms to share data. Similarly, HIPAA allows individuals to provide consent for data sharing for a specific research study, but they often must provide consent again as new research questions arise. Requiring researchers to obtain consent repeatedly makes it much more difficult to implement large-scale longitudinal studies. Finally, HIPAA requires covered entities to only disclose the minimum necessary amount of data for a specific use, but in many cases, especially when training AI systems, disclosing the complete dataset is most useful. Better regulatory clarity, model data use agreements, and increased use of a single institutional review board for HIPAA reviews for multi-site studies would make HIPAA work better. Congress should pass federal data privacy legislation that establishes basic consumer data rights, preempts state laws, ensures reliable enforcement, streamlines regulation, and minimizes the impact on innovation, including on the use of data for medical research. While HIPAA covers most U.S. healthcare data, it does not cover health data collected in other contexts, such as health data collected by consumer devices like smart watches. As Congress crafts federal data privacy legislation it should ensure that consumers can share this type of health data. In addition, Congress should establish a clear and simple way for patients to donate their medical data for research purposes, as easily as they can become an organ donor. Privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) allow entities to access, share, and analyze sensitive data without exposing personal information. PETs can reduce privacy risks, support compliance with data protection laws, and support secure biopharmaceutical collaboration. Supporting research, development, and deployment of PETs—including differential privacy, federated learning, homomorphic encryption, secure enclaves, and secure multi-party computation—can enable more computationally intensive medical research by making it easier for different entities to access and use personal health information.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/10/the-relationship-between-data-protection-regulation-and-biopharmaceutical-r-and-d/
Bernie Sanders’ Worker Dystopia: Never Lose Your Job But Never Get a Raise,2025-10-09,Robert D. Atkinson,"What happens when you combine anti-capitalism with anti-technology? Senator Bernie Sanders’ (I–Vt.) new report on AI and the labor market. There is so much that is wrong with this report, one hardly knows where to start. One place is the prominent chart that supposedly shows that wages have been stagnant, productivity has grown a fair amount, and profits have gone through the roof. Although it looks compelling, it’s inaccurate. The report describes the chart as, “But the resulting economic gains have gone almost exclusively to those at the top. While productivity has risen by 150% and corporate profits have increased more than 370%, real wages have gone down for the average American worker by nearly $30 a week.” First, it measures total profits but average wages. If it wants an apples-to-apples comparison—which it does not, because this is a piece of political propaganda—it should look at total wage growth. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), total wages increased by 649 percent from 1982 to 2025 (1982 was the earliest year available). Oops! That is more than the total profits increased. And according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , domestic corporate profit rates were about the same in the late 2010s as they were in the 1970s. Second, responding to the claim that wages have stagnated while productivity has grown is almost not even worth doing, because it has been rebutted so many times, including by the Congressional Budget Office and in my book with David Moschella , Technology Fears and Scapegoats: 40 Myths About Privacy, Jobs, AI, and Today’s Innovation Economy . But for the sake of clarity, here we go again: When using the right methods and controlling for statistical mismeasurement, there is no divergence between productivity growth and wage growth. If Senator Sanders wants to help raise the wages of American workers, he should focus on the real cause of slow wage growth: slow productivity growth from low capital investment. Instead, he wants to stymie the most promising technology today to boost productivity and wage growth—AI. The senator rightly complains about the low federal minimum wage, and I agree. At $7.25 an hour, that is a travesty. Congress should increase it to at least $12 an hour and index it to inflation. As I have written in Democracy: A Journal of Ideas , that would not only boost incomes for lower-wage workers, it would boost productivity overall, helping all American workers. Senator Sanders’ report then goes on to assert that tech has killed jobs: “Although in the past, jobs lost due to automation led to the creation of new jobs, this trend reversed from 1987 to 2016 when the impact of labor-displacing automation outstripped new job creation.” As ITIF has shown in an analysis of BLS occupational data, in no decade since 1850 has technology directly created more jobs than it has eliminated. However, joblessness throughout most of the period from 1850 to the present has not increased because the savings from productivity-driven gains are reinvested in existing economic functions, allowing jobs such as insurance agents, schoolteachers, nurses, and many others to expand. Ah, but like the now ubiquitous AI technophobes, the report asserts that this time is different: AI is coming! It quotes several CEOs who speculate that AI will eliminate a bunch of white-collar jobs. But as I wrote in The Wall Street Journal , this is fearmongering speculation that, alas, is highly unlikely to happen. I say alas because the economy desperately needs higher productivity. The report cites a Goldman Sachs study that estimates AI could lead to a worldwide loss of 300 million jobs. Three hundred million jobs! But wait—that’s less than 10 percent of jobs over ten years. In other words, this tsunami of job destruction would mean the elimination of just 1 percent of jobs a year. According to the BLS, around 6 percent of U.S. workers lose their jobs every year due to downsizing or closures. And the real punchline from the Goldman study is that global productivity is projected to increase, but only by an anemic 1.5 percent over ten years. Just when you think the report can’t get any worse, it does. Sanders’ staff decided to ask ChatGPT to predict how many jobs it would kill. You can’t make this up. What the heck does ChatGPT know about this? The staff used a fundamentally flawed method, relying on the Department of Labor’s ONET ranking of task complexity for occupations to simplistically assume that the less complex the task, the more likely it is AI will automate it. This is what Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne did over a decade ago when they wrongly predicted the loss of 47 percent of jobs. Using this measure , the occupation that Frey and Osborne predicted would have the highest risk of going the way of the buggy-whip manufacturer—insurance underwriters—actually saw employment grow by 16.4 percent from 2013 to the end of 2021. In contrast, the occupation they predicted was the least likely to be automated—recreational therapists—saw a decline of 8.9 percent in jobs. The reason is simple: machine learning and even large language models are just software. While better than anything we have had before, there are limits to what they can do. But that doesn’t stop the Luddites from crying wolf. As MIT professor and former CEO of Rethink Robotics Rodney Brooks writes, “Misled by suitcase words, people are making category errors in fungibility of capabilities—category errors comparable to seeing the rise of more efficient internal combustion engines and jumping to the conclusion that warp drives are just around the corner.” Beam me up, Scotty. However, the fundamental flaw in this report is that it channels Karl Marx’s nonsensical notion from almost two centuries ago. The report states, “While this basic analysis reflects all the inherent limitations of ChatGPT, it represents one potential future in which corporations decide to aggressively push forward with artificial labor.” One of Marx’s most egregiously wrong predictions (and there were so many) was that greedy capitalists would use technology to boost productivity, lay off workers, and keep all the gains. The result would be an immiserated proletariat, which is exactly what Senator Sanders is predicting. Ah, Marx and Sanders forget one thing: Technology does not repeal the laws of competition, which force companies to pass on all the benefits of labor-saving technologies in the form of lower prices and/or higher wages. If they didn’t do that, profit rates would be through the roof, not their current 12 percent or so of national income. In other words, for Marx and Sanders, companies automate in order to boost profits, and in the process, they immiserate workers. But is the U.S. Postal Service a greedy capitalist enterprise, given that it has used “artificial labor” to boost productivity? (A strange term they offer. Isn’t a tractor or a machine tool artificial labor?) If Sanders could get his way and most industries were nationalized, they all would want to use AI to boost productivity. But Sanders would oppose that “greed.” He criticizes President Trump for partnering “with Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic to set the table for a large-scale replacement of federal workers with AI.” So, let me get this right: If AI could boost federal government efficiency without reducing quality, which hasn’t been determined yet, Sanders would still oppose that? Because the “shareholders” of the federal government would see massive increases in income while the workers lose their jobs? But the shareholders are taxpayers, who would be able to pay lower taxes, carry a smaller national debt, or see increases in federal spending in other areas, like urban development. Put another way, Sanders wants a world where no worker ever loses their job—even if it means that their children have the same standard of living as they do. Sounds dystopian. The report then reviews corporate statements about how some, hopefully many, corporations are using AI to improve efficiency and reduce headcount. But for the authors of the report, this implies fewer jobs. And they, like so many non-economists, commit the “lump-of-labor fallacy”: the idea that there is a limited amount of work to be done and, if a job is eliminated, it’s gone for good. But this fails to account for second-order effects in which the savings from increased productivity are recycled into the economy in the form of higher wages, higher profits, and reduced prices, all of which generate new demand that, in turn, creates other jobs. Some jobs are in new occupations, such as “content creator assistants,” but most are in existing ones that workers will now spend their savings on, like personal trainers, for example. This is why the majority of scholarly studies find no net negative effect of productivity on employment. And we get to the end of the report to find that this “analysis” is merely a setup to justify Senator Sanders’ progressive social, labor, and economic policy agenda. If he wants to advance that agenda, feel free; some of it ITIF supports, such as improvements to the unemployment insurance system and paid parental leave. But don’t distort reality or the benefits of AI to do that. Finally, the idea of a robot tax and “ending tax breaks for automation” may be among the worst policy proposals of our era. They would result in even lower wage growth, and we might just end up handing over most of manufacturing to China. Here, like most of the report, it cites fundamentally flawed work. In this case, the Brookings Institution , which in recent years has become decidedly anti-tech: “According to a study from the Brookings Institution, the tax code structurally favors investments in AI and automation over labor.” No, it doesn’t. Companies can expense labor costs in the first year but at least until the passage of the Big Beautiful Bill, generally could not do the same for capital equipment. I am glad the senator released this report because it highlights perhaps the most important economic issue of the day that needs a robust and open debate : Should workers have protection from automation? Let’s get this out in the open and debate it fairly. If one believes they should, then the proposal from Senator Sanders and all those similar should be embraced. However, if one believes that this is fundamentally giving in to selfishness and fear, then most of the related proposals should be rejected outright. The reality is that we now live in a Rawlsian world where it is unethical to have anyone be hurt, whether emotionally or economically. Redistributionist philosopher John Rawls wrote that the goal should be “maintaining conditions and achieving objectives that are similarly to everyone’s advantage.” Following Rawlsian ethics, there can be no automation in an organization because, while 99.999 percent of society will benefit, 0.001 percent will be hurt. Under this ethical framework, progress is virtually impossible, and creative destruction caused by technology would be illegal. In their growing anti-capitalist animus, both the left and the new right identify the public interest with the interests of workers. For example, the Center for American Progress published an article titled “Will AI Benefit or Harm Workers?” But why workers? Why not children, students, retirees, business owners, or even workers in non-automatable roles? In reality, society is a collection of interests, and if we define the national interest by any particular interest—in this case a worker who might lose their job—we are doomed to economic stagnation. So, no, workers do not deserve protection from automation. What they do deserve is access to robust retraining and support programs to help them transition to new jobs if laid off.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/09/bernie-sanders-worker-dystopia-never-lose-job-never-get-raise/
US tech firms face growing scrutiny from South Korean antitrust regulator,2025-10-11,,"As trade tensions between the United States and South Korea persist, American companies operating in the East Asian country are expected to continue bearing the brunt of the fallout from the Trump administration’s immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia last month. The raid resulted in the detention of more than 300 Korean nationals, who were eventually returned to their native country. In response, the Korean government said it was investigating whether human rights abuses were committed during the Hyundai raid. Yet, American companies have been subjected to harassment by Korean authorities for years. Top Netanyahu confidant who led Israeli ceasefire negotiation team resigns Cold and disease threaten postceasefire Gaza as winter approaches Outgoing BBC executive tells staff to 'fight' for journalism without addressing Trump lawsuit threat The Korea Fair Trade Commission, the country’s antitrust regulator, frequently conducts surprise raids at offices owned by U.S. tech firms in Seoul and levies significant fines over allegations of unfair business practices. As an administrative body, the KFTC does not need court-issued search warrants such as those reserved for criminal matters. However, KFTC investigators must obtain consent before inspecting a business. Theoretically, an executive could bar their entry, but in reality, taking a stand would likely invite further harassment from the antitrust regulator. One of the commonly targeted firms is Coupang, a U.S. tech company and online retailer primarily operating in South Korea. It was fined $98 million last year for allegedly using deceptive algorithm-based practices, which are common in retail. In 2023, the KFTC fined Google $29.4 million for blocking the release of mobile video games on a competitor’s platform. Two years before, Google was fined $177 million for allegedly blocking customized versions of its Android operating system. Apple was also hit with a fine in 2021, although the amount was considerably less than Google’s $177 million sanction. The iPhone maker was fined $264,000 based on allegations that it obstructed KFTC raids. The National Bureau of Asian Research cites Coupang, Google, Apple, and others as examples of U.S. firms that are frequently targeted in these investigations, more so than Korean or Chinese firms. “While the KFTC also investigates South Korean firms (like Naver and Kakao), U.S. firms have consistently been the target of major enforcement action,” Nigel Cory and Robert Holleyman wrote in a policy brief for the think tank. “Meanwhile, the KFTC exempts smaller firms and, in effect, Chinese rivals.” One foreign relations expert argued that while Chinese firms may benefit from a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s not because the KFTC aims to actively support China. “U.S. firms are the ones that are choosing not to invest or to pull out [of South Korea], while Chinese companies either find ways to manage the KFTC’s actions or are not affected because the Chinese companies that are investing are smaller and thus more under the radar,” Henry Haggard, former minister counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, told the Washington Examiner . While he doesn’t believe the KFTC is carrying out a specific anti-American agenda in its hostile approach to U.S. firms, Haggard said it is unintentionally stalling U.S. investments in South Korea. South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung warned that the same chilling effect could happen to Korean companies’ investments in the U.S., but attributed the cause to the Hyundai raid, the fallout of which continues to play out as trade talks between the two nations develop. “The ICE raid has changed the political calculus for the Lee government,” Haggard said. “Until the raid, [Lee] had successfully countered those members of his party and cabinet who hoped for a different deal, a more sovereignist approach and a harder negotiating line,” he added. “With the raid, he no longer has a free hand and has to negotiate more within his own party, publicly and privately, and this will make the negotiations more intense and potentially more confrontational.” The trade deal was signed in July but has not yet been finalized. Negotiations may come to a close sometime this month ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to hold a bilateral meeting with Lee ahead of the two-day summit from Oct. 31 to Nov. 1, although his schedule is subject to change. Haggard suspects the final agreement may look like the one between the U.S. and Japan. As part of the deal , Trump moved to implement 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese imports, down from the proposed 25% rate, and Japan agreed to invest $550 billion in the U.S. In the meantime, the U.S.-South Korea trade deal is beset by nontariff barriers. These obstacles are not only KFTC enforcement actions but also Korean tech regulations that disproportionately affect U.S. firms. The Korean government is currently advancing the Online Platform Fairness Act, which the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation describes as “discriminatory” in the bill’s differing treatment between domestic and foreign companies. A similar bill, called the Online Platform Monopoly Act, was modeled after the European Union’s Digital Markets Act and thus more overt in its antimonopolization purpose. Legislative movement on the Monopoly Act halted after the Trump administration and Congress raised concerns about the bill targeting U.S. tech firms, but the ITIF argued South Korea is still proceeding with the discriminatory legislation in the form of the Fairness Act. “This looks like a classic bait and switch. Korea proposed two discriminatory bills, then paused the obvious one after U.S. pushback while quietly advancing the other,” Lilla Nora Kiss and Hilal Aka wrote in July. “United States officials should not be hoodwinked: If a country proposes an extreme measure, then replaces it with an equally harmful policy while calling it a compromise, that’s not moderation. The Fairness Act is the same attack in different packaging.” Korean officials maintain the bill is necessary to combat large corporations’ abuse of market dominance and superior bargaining positions over small businesses. Underlying South Korea’s push to regulate large online platforms is the politics of it all. Lee assumed office in June as the head of the country’s liberal Democratic Party, wresting control from the conservative People Power Party. The latter party faced a crisis late last year when former President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, a decision that ultimately led to his impeachment and removal from office. KEMP TRAVELING TO SOUTH KOREA AFTER HYUNDAI IMMIGRATION RAID With Lee in power, South Korea is expected to strengthen corporate regulations in line with the ruling party’s progressive policies. The man assisting Lee in that mission is KFTC Chairman Joo Byung-ki, who began his three-year term on Sept. 15. Joo has been outspoken in his calls for harsher penalties for corporations, indicating that the KFTC will only intensify its antitrust investigations of U.S. firms.

"Comments to the FCC Regarding Applications Filed for the Transfer of Cox Enterprises, Inc. to Charter Communications Introduction The Merger Will Increase Competition in the Broadband Market Consumer Gains From the Merger Go Beyond Pricing, Including Network Upgrades Endnotes",2025-10-07,Ellis Scherer,"The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) appreciates the opportunity to comment on the applications for Commission approval for the transfer of control of Cox Communications, Inc. (Cox), to Charter Communications, Inc. (Charter.) [1] This merger will be a win for consumers and regulators should not stand in the way. Deploying broadband infrastructure requires ISPs to incur steep upfront costs that they recoup over time in consumers’ monthly bills. Market concentration can help keep prices down by spreading out fixed costs among a larger number of customers. Critics contend mergers and acquisitions like this undermine competition. But that is far from the case in the consumer broadband market. For one thing, the marketplace is converging such that fixed wireline providers like Cox and Charter now face competition not just from each other but also from fiber, satellite, and fixed wireless providers that also deliver high-speed Internet service. [2] For another thing, deploying broadband infrastructure requires ISPs to incur steep upfront costs that they must recoup over time in consumers’ monthly bills. Mergers create better economies of scale and allow those costs to be spread among more customers, so ISPs can make big investments to upgrade infrastructure without raising prices. [3] The Cox Communications merger also will be able to combine administrative functions, eliminate duplicative deployment costs, and increase operational efficiency. Charter predicts the merger will cut operating costs by $500 million within the first three years of the transaction’s close. [4] In turn, that reduced cost will then be shared across a larger, combined footprint of 36 million customers. [5] The result is less expensive, high-quality Internet service for those millions of Americans. Another significant benefit of the merger is that reduced costs will allow Cox Communications to invest in infrastructure upgrades. Part of remaining competitive is ensuring cable broadband technology has the same performance capabilities as other broadband technologies in the market. For example, this merger comes at a time when the Data Over Cable Interface Specifications (DOCSIS), an industry standard for cable Internet, is in its fourth generation (DOCSIS 4.0). [6] The technology enables gigabit speeds, low latency, and enhanced security for cable Internet customers, but updating infrastructure to DOCSIS 4.0 is expensive. This merger allows for the money saved through cost-cutting to be allocated towards those network upgrades and innovation, ensuring customers get next-generation, high-speed Internet even while competitive prices persist. The key point is that consumers don’t benefit from simply adding new ISPs to the market. While the number of competing ISPs is on the rise, we’re also in a period of technological convergence. Cable companies are not just competing with other cable companies, they are competing against all broadband providers, including former telephone networks now turned to fiber, fixed wireless 5G networks, and low-earth-orbit satellite constellations. Reshuffling the market to have fewer, stronger competitors will create a more stable long-term environment for competition to play out. And, while technological convergence is heating up competition, companies like Cox and Charter must find ways to reduce costs or they will lose market share to ISPs who can. Thank you for your consideration. [1] . Founded in 2006, ITIF is an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute—a think tank.

China Will Exploit Britain’s Refusal to Name It an Enemy,2025-10-09,Matthew Kilcoyne,"A major espionage case against British nationals who were formerly alleged to be spies collapsed last month because prosecutors could not find UK government witnesses willing to testify that China represented a “ threat to national security ”—the legal threshold for prosecuting espionage. Even worse, despite knowing now the importance of making this pronouncement, the UK government still maintains its silence on China. Winston Churchill would be appalled at his successors’ unwillingness to call out hostile intelligence gathering out of fear of economic blowback. The UK’s use of diplomatic euphemisms has become a strategic liability that China will continue to expertly exploit unless the UK government makes a change. Under the UK’s Official Secrets Act, prosecutors must prove information was useful to an “enemy,” which the courts have established means “a country which represents at the time of the offence, a threat to the national security of the UK.” Prosecutors spent months seeking evidence that Chinese espionage represented a threat to national security. But the previous government characterized it as an “ epoch-defining and systemic challenge .” In the end, not only did this case collapse, but the failed prosecution grants effective immunity for any espionage conducted by China between 2021 and 2023. This paralysis directly threatens Britain’s technology sector as China has penetrated every major and future-focused sector —semiconductors, AI, quantum, and universities. Under the National Security and Investment Act, the UK government blocks roughly 4 in 10 attempted Chinese investments in semiconductors, AI, and quantum computing on national security grounds. Yet it won’t formally state that China is a threat when prosecuting alleged espionage targeting the exact same technologies. The incoherence is glaring: The UK rightly scrutinises Chinese commercial deals, but it grants China effective immunity for intelligence operations. British firms and academic institutions (as well as democratic institutions) face a systematic Chinese threat via recruitment efforts, research partnerships, and IP extraction. Yet the recent collapsed espionage prosecution sends a devastating message: The government lacks the resolve to defend British economic security interests in court. Successive UK governments—Conservative and Labour—have refused to formally designate China as a national security threat, even as MI5 publicly warns of Chinese espionage “ on a pretty epic scale .” This isn’t legal confusion; it’s calculated capitulation to economic leverage. What constrains British policy is supply-chain dependency: UK semiconductor, AI, and clean energy sectors rely on Chinese rare earth processing , component manufacturing, and critical technology inputs. Beijing could strangle UK technology competitiveness through targeted supply restrictions—as it demonstrated when it slapped Australia with billions in trade sanctions after Canberra requested a COVID inquiry. Quite grimly, the UK is discovering it has been playing a different game than China. China has systematically engineered—not for profit, but for strategic advantage—economic dependency. Britain outsourced much of its industrial capacity to the nation now conducting espionage against it, creating a hostage situation where clear threat designation risks provoking a suffocating economic attack. As a result, the need to maintain uninterrupted Chinese supply chains has taken precedence over clearly articulating the threat China’s intelligence operations pose to British innovation. The policy failure is bipartisan. The previous government chose euphemism—an “ epoch-defining challenge ,” a “ top priority ,” and a “ complex partner ”—and the current government similarly refuses to unequivocally state China is a threat. Both prioritise catering to Beijing’s sensitivities over Britain’s security interests. Admiral Nelson’s signal at Trafalgar declared, “England expects every man to do his duty”—England does not expect them, nor should it want them to do Beijing’s bidding. If Britain won’t prosecute alleged espionage targeting its democracy, it won’t muster the resolve for economic and technology competition. China respects resolve, not timidity.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/09/china-will-exploit-britains-refusal-to-name-it-an-enemy/
Three Fixes to Improve the UK’s Online Safety Act,2025-10-06,Matthew Kilcoyne; Daniel Castro,"UK policymakers designed the Online Safety Act to protect children from harmful online content by requiring online services to verify users’ ages and restrict access to material like pornography, self-harm content, and other age-inappropriate material. But the Act has had a series of high-profile failures in its first few months of implementation, as some innocuous online forums have shut down entirely to avoid liability risks, while other legitimate support communities, such as those for sexual assault survivors or people who want to quit smoking , now require government ID verification, which means users have no expectation of anonymity when accessing these sites. This domestic policy headache has also become a major international liability, with policymakers abroad criticizing UK regulators for censoring foreign companies . One of the main problems is that the Act encourages overzealous compliance and enforcement, resulting in unnecessary content restrictions that deviate from the goals of the law. However, there are three steps Parliament and Ofcom, the UK regulator tasked with enforcing the Act, should take to address this problem. Give Platforms More Guidance on What Constitutes Harmful Content The Problem : The Act does not provide sufficient guidance on which harmful, but legal, content platforms must protect children against, resulting in unnecessary content restrictions. The Fix : The government should narrow the categories of content that it requires platforms to protect children against to a clear and unambiguous set. The Act’s list of categories includes a wide range of ill-defined content, such as “bullying content” or “content which encourages…behaviours associated with an eating disorder.” Without clear definitions and criteria for evaluating content, risk-averse online services must address any content that might potentially fall under these categories, such as inside jokes and memes or articles about diets and weight loss, to avoid running afoul of the Act. Ideally, Ofcom would immediately provide this regulatory clarity through its existing authority, but since the Act creates some of these broad categories, Parliament may need to make some of these changes. Give Platforms Time to Fix Problems Before Imposing Fines The Problem : Online services face fines for any compliance failures, creating pressure to implement overly broad restrictions rather than risk regulatory action. The Fix : Parliament should amend the Act to require Ofcom to offer a remediation period (e.g., 30-60 days) to online services and only impose penalties for continued non-compliance. While Ofcom has developed informal “ alternative compliance tools ,” including “compliance remediation” where it gives service providers “the opportunity to address or remedy any compliance concerns identified in lieu of opening an investigation,” the Act allows Ofcom to impose penalties immediately upon finding a breach of duties. Platforms currently don’t know when Ofcom will use these discretionary tools versus immediate enforcement action, creating uncertainty that drives unnecessary restrictions to ensure compliance. This approach has extensive precedent across UK regulation—the Communications Act 2003 requires representation periods, the FCA provides warning periods before penalties, and the CMA offers remedy opportunities before fines. Require Judicial Review for Restrictions on Content The Problem : Regulators face political pressure to demonstrate they are protecting children, but bear no cost when they err on the side of excessive content restrictions. The Fix : Parliament should amend the Act to require that Ofcom’s restrictions on content go through courts, just like other restrictions on speech rights. Courts providing independent oversight ensure that regulators’ content restrictions meet proper legal standards and proportionality requirements. Independent oversight of all content restrictions, especially for subjective “legal but harmful” content, prevents regulatory overreach. Courts can review urgent actions within 72 hours to confirm they meet legal standards or use post-action review when urgency requires more immediate action. The UK already requires court approval for ISP blocking orders under copyright law, and courts routinely handle content injunctions in defamation and privacy cases. Judges would ensure content restrictions meet proper legal standards and protect free speech rights while still allowing swift action against genuinely harmful or illegal material. This approach creates the same procedural safeguards the UK uses for other fundamental rights. Creating A More Effective Framework for Child Protection The Online Safety Act has worthwhile elements, especially the addition of new criminal offenses for individuals who engage in cyberflashing, intimate image abuse, or epilepsy trolling. However, the current implementation has created a problematic incentive structure where platforms go beyond what the law requires, implementing restrictions that likely contradict what their users actually want, simply to avoid the risk of regulatory penalties. These three changes leverage existing UK regulatory frameworks to create a more targeted, predictable system that actually protects children while preserving legitimate online discourse.

Korea Enters the Global Top Four in Innovation—Now It Must Turn Knowledge Into Scaled Firms,2025-10-07,Sejin Kim,"The Global Innovation Index (GII), published annually by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and its partners, ranks economies on their ability to generate and commercialize innovation. It has become the world’s most widely used yardstick for benchmarking innovation policy. In the 2025 edition , Korea entered the global top four, rising from sixth place in 2024. That achievement reflects long-standing strengths in research intensity and corporate R&D, but it also raises tough questions about how to turn knowledge into scaled firms. At the metro level, Seoul ranks fifth in WIPO’s Top 100 Innovation Clusters for 2025, trailing only Shenzhen–Hong Kong–Guangzhou, Tokyo–Yokohama, San Jose–San Francisco, and Beijing. Seoul accounts for more than 5 percent of global PCT filings, about 3 percent of global venture capital deals, and nearly 2 percent of global scientific publications—a rare combination of IP strength and growing venture activity in a single metro area. And it is not only the capital. Daejeon, long recognized as a science city, ranks 25th worldwide and 15th in innovation intensity per capita. This shows how tightly concentrated research capacity can translate into global visibility when sustained by universities and public labs. Meanwhile, Busan remains within the top 100, ranking 95th worldwide and 86th in innovation intensity per capita. The broader success rests on relentless business R&D: Korea ranks first globally for GERD performed by business (as a percentage of GDP) and continues to generate patents at a scale few economies can match. In terms of pure knowledge production, Korea has delivered exactly what policymakers hoped for when they set targets two decades ago. However, while Korea’s inputs are world-class, the translation into market results still lags. In 2025, Korea ranks fourth on innovation inputs but only sixth on outputs—an explicit input–output gap that underscores the need to convert knowledge into scaled, globally competitive firms. IPO activity was not the weak link in early 2025. According to EY , Korea recorded 38 IPOs in the first half of 2025, the second-highest first-half total in 22 years and nearly matching the 2021 peak of 40. That is a sign of resilience. Yet the startup M&A channel—crucial for recycling talent and capital—remains soft, with local reporting pointing to a continuing “startup M&A winter.” In short, listings remain strong, but trade sales are thin, narrowing the set of viable scale-up paths for venture-backed firms. A second friction is foreign capital. Korea’s overall investment position looks like a net exporter of risk: Inward FDI fell 20 percent year over year to $15.2 billion in 2024, while outward FDI rose to $48.6 billion, according to the UN Trade and Development’s 2025 Country Fact Sheet . The GII 2025 country profile reinforces the point, ranking FDI net inflows (as a percentage of GDP) 108th—a stark outlier for a top-five innovation system. If late-stage domestic pools are not deep enough, and cross-border capital faces frictions, promising firms encounter a funding valley between Series A and scale. On firm creation at the frontier, Korea is competitive but not yet dominant. The GII’s measure of “unicorn valuation as a percentage of GDP” ranks Korea 27th, reinforcing the finding that scaled outcomes lag behind the country’s scientific and patent strengths. That ranking mirrors the GII’s broader message: robust inputs, a solid pipeline, but fewer scaled outcomes than Korea’s science and patent position would predict. So, what comes next? Korea should: Deepen growth-stage capital by empowering pension funds and other institutional investors with mandates and evaluation horizons that accommodate late-stage venture and growth equity in capital-intensive fields such as AI hardware, biotech platforms, and space technology. Stabilize the rules and widen exits , providing predictable, technology-neutral regulation and reducing frictions for cross-border M&A while courting foreign buyers. Make scale the key metric , tying national programs to revenue growth, export intensity, and private co-investment rather than firm counts or grant volumes. For the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, this means shifting from providing survival assistance to setting explicit targets for firm-size expansion. Pull in global capital by streamlining inbound FDI processes and actively marketing late-stage rounds to foreign institutions. Outward FDI shows global ambition; inward FDI needs to catch up if domestic scale-ups are to accelerate. Breaking into the GII’s global top four is a milestone, not a finish line. The data shows that Korea has the necessary inputs—patents, researchers, corporate R&D—and that Seoul now pairs IP strength with real venture activity. The test for the next five years is whether Korea can convert knowledge into scaled firms that lift productivity and compete globally. Measure success by scale-up throughput and global reach, not inputs alone. That is how a patent-and-paper powerhouse becomes a market powerhouse.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/07/korea-enters-global-top-four-innovation-now-turn-knowledge-into-scaled-firms/
"Banning Teens from Social Media Isn’t Protection, It’s Overreach",2025-10-06,Ash Johnson,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU will partner with Australia to restrict children’s access to social media, expanding on Australia’s world-first ban for users under 16 and joining a growing international movement to limit youth access online. While these bans aim to protect young people online, they risk cutting off millions of teenagers from vital platforms for staying informed, connected, and expressing themselves, while also threatening adults’ online anonymity. A more effective solution would focus on addressing real online harms directly, preserving social media’s benefits, and empowering parents and teens with greater control over their digital experience. Australia was the first country to implement a nationwide social media ban for children under 16. This ban would primarily affect children aged 13 to 15, as major social media platforms already restrict children under 13 from creating accounts. The ban places the burden of “taking reasonable steps to prevent access” to users under 16 on platforms themselves and gives the country’s eSafety Commissioner the power to enforce this requirement. It includes exceptions for educational and informational content , but no exceptions for teens who have their parents’ permission to use social media or who already have social media accounts. Following Australia’s ban, government officials began calling for similar bans in the UK and New Zealand . These bans are part of a global debate over the best way to mitigate the potential harmful effects of social media on children, including exposure to predatory adults or age-inappropriate content, overreliance on social media rather than face-to-face interaction, negative body image that may lead to disordered eating, unhealthy social comparison, excessive screen time, and a lack of physical activity. However, social media also has many benefits for teens , including access to community, contact with distant friends and family, support for members of marginalized groups, entertainment, educational content, and political and social awareness. While some teens have overall negative experiences with social media, many have overall positive experiences. Policymakers should weigh both experiences equally and come up with solutions that maximize the benefits of social media for young people while minimizing the risks. In addition to cutting teens off from the benefits of social media, banning all children under a certain age from social media is nearly impossible to implement without violating the privacy and free speech rights of adults. In order to ensure children cannot lie about their age in order to gain access to social media, platforms would need to verify the ages of all users. This could include requiring all users to perform ID checks, turning over their personal information , and forfeiting their anonymity. While there are less invasive ways to attempt to age-gate social media, such as age estimation powered by artificial intelligence (AI), no method of age verification is foolproof. Teens could access their parents’ IDs, create their own fake IDs, use VPNs to evade location-specific social media bans, or convince their parents to set up an account on their behalf. Rather than passing blanket bans that treat all teenagers the same, regardless of their unique circumstances or parents’ preferences, countries should allow children to benefit from social media while giving them and their parents more control over their online experience. An alternative to age verification could be a child flag system , which would require device operating systems to create a “trustworthy child flag” for user accounts that signal to apps and websites that a user is underage and requires apps and websites that serve age-restricted content to check for this signal from their users and block flagged users from this content. Rather than using ID checks or biometric verification to determine whether to activate this child flag option, this would be an opt-in process built into existing parental controls on devices. Parents could activate or disable the child flag option depending on their own values and the maturity of their children. Additionally, devices could default to certain parental controls recommended for children, with different settings recommended for different age groups, much like movie and video game rating systems. Countries should also prioritize the development of digital IDs that allow users to turn over only relevant information about themselves, such as whether or not they are over a certain age, without revealing personal information and sacrificing their anonymity. In addition, countries should fund research and testing of photo-based AI age estimation to evaluate and improve these systems’ accuracy. By implementing less invasive and more convenient measures of identifying underage users and giving parents the final say on their children’s online experience, countries would create options for parents and children to protect themselves. This more nuanced approach would more effectively address the potential harms of social media, along with other online spaces, while preserving the benefits of age-appropriate online spaces for children and teens.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/06/banning-teens-from-social-media-isnt-protection-its-overreach/
Asian Students Are America’s STEM Advantage: Why Merit Should Matter,2025-10-07,Trelysa Long,"There is broad agreement in the United States that we need more STEM graduates. While the Trump administration wants those graduates to be American-born , as it turns out, Asians earn bachelor’s degrees in STEM fields at higher rates than any other racial or ethnic group. Moreover, regardless of citizenship status, Asians pursue these degrees at higher rates than U.S.-born citizens across all groups, with those who have obtained citizenship through naturalization and those without citizenship doing so at the highest rates. These students, along with their immigrant families, strengthen American STEM education, helping to close the significant talent gap and accelerate advanced industries, which is crucial given China’s techno-economic rise. Yet some educational institutions are moving away from merit-based admissions in an attempt to foster “equal opportunity” and racial diversity—initiatives that can disadvantage entire groups of students despite strong academic performance. Policymakers should ensure that admissions in academic settings are merit-based, protecting equal treatment for all students and sustaining the excellence and innovation that underpin U.S. competitiveness. Regardless of citizenship status, Asian students pursue bachelor’s degrees in STEM at much higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. In 2023, Census Bureau ACS data showed that 18 percent of Asians who attained a bachelor’s degree earned a STEM degree, compared to 6 percent of White students and 6 percent across all racial groups. (See figure 1.) Figure 1: STEM degrees share of the total bachelor's degrees by race in 2023 (all citizenship status) This is no surprise, as the top three bachelor’s degree majors for all races were in non-STEM areas. Indeed, for all races, the top majors were business management, psychology, and nursing. For White students, the top three degrees were also non-STEM degrees: business administration, psychology, and general business. Yet for Asians, two of the top three majors were STEM fields: first, computer science, and second, electrical engineering. (See table 1.) Table 1: Top bachelor's degree majors by race in 2023 Rank All Races White Asian 1 Business Management and Administration Business Management and Administration Computer Science 2 Psychology Psychology Electrical Engineering 3 Nursing General Business Nursing Over time, Asian students have consistently pursued STEM bachelor’s degrees at higher rates. From 2013 to 2023 (with no data for 2020), about 15 percent or more of Asian students who earned a bachelor’s degree majored in STEM. In comparison, only 4 to 6 percent of White students earned STEM degrees. The overall average across all races also remained between 4 and 6 percent. (See figure 2.) Figure 2: STEM degrees share of the total bachelor's degrees by race from 2013 to 2023 (regardless of citizenship status) When disaggregated by citizenship status, Asians still consistently pursued STEM bachelor’s degrees at higher rates. For those with U.S. citizenship by birth, 7 to 10 percent of Asian Americans who earned a bachelor’s degree did so in STEM fields from 2013 to 2023. In comparison, only 4 to 6 percent of White students with a bachelor’s degree did so in STEM. Similarly, only 4 to 5 percent of people across all races attained a STEM degree. (See figure 3.) Figure 3: U.S. citizens through birth's STEM degrees share of the total bachelor's degrees by race from 2013 to 2023 Asians who attained U.S. citizenship through naturalization pursued STEM degrees at an even higher rate. Between 2013 and 2023, 17 to 20 percent of Asian students with naturalized citizenship who earned a bachelor’s degree pursued it in STEM. Only 4 to 5 percent of U.S.-born citizens across all races did the same. (See figure 3.) In other words, naturalized Asian immigrants also significantly expand the United States STEM talent pipeline. Figure 4: STEM degrees share of the total bachelor's degrees by race and citizenship attainment method from 2013 to 2023 Asians without U.S. citizenship pursued STEM at even higher rates than Asians with citizenship. From 2013 to 2023, 22 to 29 percent of non-citizen Asians who earned a bachelor’s degree did so in STEM fields, compared to just 4 to 5 percent of U.S.-born citizens across all racial groups. As such, non-citizen Asians who choose to stay in the United States after graduation contribute heavily to sustaining the U.S. STEM talent base and reducing the STEM skills shortage. (See figure 4.) Figure 5: STEM degrees share of the total bachelor's degrees by race and citizenship status from 2013 to 2023 One clear implication of Asians’ higher likelihood of pursuing degrees in STEM fields is the need to reject affirmative action programs that discriminate against them. The Supreme Court’s Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard decision in 2023 made that point unmistakably. Evidence showed that Harvard systematically gave Asian American applicants lower scores on subjective “personal ratings,” even when they excelled academically and in extracurriculars. In other words, their success was treated as a problem to be managed rather than a strength to be rewarded. Asian students have also faced discrimination at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, one of the nation’s top STEM magnet schools. In 2020, the school changed its admissions process from one focused on merit to a “holistic” one designed to reduce the share of students from a particular race. As a result, the share of Asian American students fell from 73 percent to 54 percent in just one year, despite their strong performance in merit-based criteria. These two cases highlight why admissions in educational institutions should uphold merit-based standards that ensure no group of students is disadvantaged. As Justice Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion for the Harvard case: Yet Harvard and UNC now forthrightly state that they racially discriminate when it comes to admitting students. They argue that their discrimination is a good thing that ought to continue indefinitely, and they encourage the Court to look past discrimination against Asian applicants and focus instead on the supposed benefits of race-conscious admission programs for blacks and Hispanics. But the Constitution embodies a simple truth: Two discriminatory wrongs cannot make a right. Not only are such initiatives counterproductive in terms of providing “equal opportunity,” but they also discourage the very excellence and innovation needed for sustained economic growth. As Americans, we should be grateful that Asian students are entering STEM fields at such high rates, especially given the significant talent shortage. Their ongoing commitment strengthens our nation’s innovation capacity, industrial base, and global competitiveness. Academic success is an asset that should be rewarded, not penalized.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/07/asian-students-are-americas-stem-advantage-why-merit-should-matter/
"Taxing University Royalties Would Deliver Few Benefits, but Great Harms",2025-10-07,Stephen Ezell,"One attribute that distinguishes America’s innovation system from that of virtually any other nation is that the United States has transformed its universities into engines of innovation. From 1996 to 2020, academic technology transfer activities by U.S. universities have generated over 117,000 patents, 19,000 startups, and hundreds of innovative drugs. America’s leadership in global innovation is not a given, and it will be lost if policymakers do not remain committed to enacting public policies that keep America the world’s leading location to undertake the difficult, complex, risky, and expensive process of innovation. Unfortunately, a misguided proposal from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to have the government claim half the patent earnings from university inventions derived in part from federal research and development (R&D) funding threatens to significantly undermine this system while delivering very little benefit to taxpayers. The Bayh-Dole Act , passed by Congress on a bipartisan basis in 1980, undergirds America’s world-leading academic tech transfer system. The legislation gives universities rights to the intellectual property (IP) derived from federal R&D funding, which they can then license out—often in exchange for royalties should the IP lead to successfully commercialized products—to entrepreneurs, start-ups, or small companies. In fact, 73 percent of university licensing deals involve start-ups or small companies. On average, three new start-up companies and two new products are launched in the United States every day as a result of university inventions brought to market in part thanks to the Bayh-Dole Act. Beyond the aforementioned patents and startups, academic tech transfer activity since 1996 has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion, contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output, and supported 6.5 million jobs. In the Axios interview where he proposed this, secretary Lutnick asserted that “the U.S. government is getting no return on the money it invests in federal research.” He stated , “The scientists get the patents, the universities get the patents, and the funder of $50 billion, the U.S. government, you know what we get? Zero.” Since when did the U.S. government become an interest group. What benefit does it get from funding roads? Or funding national parks? Even worse, this assertion is simply incorrect. The U.S. taxpayer—and government—benefits greatly from this R&D funding, first from the extensive innovations produced from the academic tech transfer process, which alone has produced hundreds of life-saving drugs and vaccines, including treatments for breast, ovarian, prostate , and skin cancer, not to mention other breakthroughs in everything from Honeycrisp apples and neoprene to cloud and quantum computing. Second, the government benefits from the taxes produced by the trillions in industrial output and millions of jobs created as a result of university tech transfer. Moreover, academic tech transfer has led to the flourishing of university research parks across the country. A study by the Association of University Research Parks (AURP), finds that those parks alone generated $33 billion in federal tax revenue last year. In the Axios interview, Lutnick further contended that “the American taxpayer should be a partner in the upside” of federally funded university research (as already shown, they well are) and then went on to claim that [if half the university royalties were taken by the government] then “our social security system would be paid for, and America wouldn’t be a broke country.” So it’s now time to point out just how lucrative these university IP royalties are: in 2023, American universities generated $3.6 billion in patent income. In 2024, that number fell by 23 percent, to about $2.7 billion. Taking half that (i.e., $1.35 billion) would barely get the United States through half of one day’s worth of Social Security expenditures (which averaged $4.11 billion in 2024). Moreover, the aforementioned $33 billion in tax revenues generated by university research parks already delivers over 20 times more in tax revenues than the government would get from claiming half of the annual university royalty revenues. Secretary Lutnick appears to erroneously believe there’s an enormously lucrative pot of university licensing revenue out there, but that betrays a serious misunderstanding of just how difficult the process of commercializing new innovations is. For instance, a 2023 study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that out of 605 active royalty revenue generating licenses, only four licenses (0.66 percent) generated over $1 million in revenues. So there’s very little for the government to gain here; yet the damage could be severe. As noted, successful commercialization of university IP is already fraught with difficulties and tenuous at best. If universities doubled their license fees to ‘get back to even,’ potential licensors would be less likely to take a university license. Suppose that universities didn’t raise their fees, but lost half the revenues they now get, then they would be less inclined to undertake licensing activity. Moreover, it would deprive universities of the licensing revenue that plays an important role in funding everything from wet labs for scientists to university incubators and accelerators that play critical roles in seeding the next generation of innovation. It’s also worth noting that the originally proposed Bayh-Dole legislation included a partial royalty payback provision to the government, but when Birch Bayh and Bob Dole consulted with federal agencies about it, they were informed the expense and bureaucratic effort to administer such a payback program weren’t worth the meager revenues expected therefrom (and so the provision was dropped from the final legislation.) In other words, the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze in 1980; it’s certainly not now. It should further be noted that America’s successful academic tech transfer system is complemented by the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which sets aside 3 percent of extramural research funding (about $2.5 billion) from 11 federal agencies to support innovative small businesses. Called “America’s Seed Fund,” SBIR itself has generated 70,000 patents and 700 public companies. Unfortunately, not only did Congress fail to renew the SBIR program before it expired on September 30, 2025 , with the current government shutdown, the program is in hiatus. Innovative American universities represent a crown jewel in America’s innovation system; but that treasure cannot be taken for granted. The Trump administration should abandon proposals to tax university IP royalties, work with Congress to get the SBIR program reauthorized when the shutdown ends, reverse the extensive cuts it has proposed to federal science and R&D funding, and recommit to policies laser focused on maintaining America’s innovation edge. That’s because America’s leadership in global innovation is not a given, and it will be lost if policymakers don’t remain committed to enacting public policies that keep America the world’s leading location to undertake the difficulty, complex, risky, and expensive process of innovation.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/07/taxing-university-royalties-would-deliver-few-benefits-but-great-harms/
Fact of the Week: Over $1.4T More Venture Capital Funding Was Invested in U.S.-headquartered Firms than in European Firms,2025-10-06,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), ( SINV-31 ; accessed October 2025). Commentary: Venture capital (VC) funding is a crucial input for entrepreneurship and innovation, supporting early-stage start-ups that are deemed too risky for other forms of capital support. Compared to the United States, VC activity in the European Union (EU) is low, with EU-headquartered firms receiving $1.4 trillion less VC funding than their American counterparts from 2013 to 2022. Annual VC investments in European firms averaged just 0.2 percent of European GDP over this time period, compared to 0.7 percent in the United States. This investment gap has also grown substantially in recent years. In 2013, U.S.-headquartered firms received $43 billion more in capital investment than European firms; by 2022, that gap had grown to $186 billion.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/06/more-venture-capital-funding-invested-us-headquartered-firms-than-european-firms/
Tech think tank argues California’s new AI law harms national efforts,,,,,https://insideaipolicy.com/share/18851
California’s AI Safety Law Gets More Wrong Than Right,2025-10-03,Hodan Omaar,"California has passed a new AI safety law , and supporters are touting a trifecta of benefits: protecting innovation while advancing safety, filling a regulatory gap left by congressional inaction, and positioning the United States as a global leader on AI safety. On substance, the law has some merits, and had it been enacted at the federal level, it could have marked imperfect but genuine progress. But by adopting those provisions at the state level, California does more harm than good on the very same fronts it claims as strengths. The law undermines U.S. innovation by fragmenting the national market, making bipartisan compromise on a national AI framework more difficult, and blurring America’s position on AI governance. The law focuses on frontier AI developers, defined as companies training AI systems using more than 10²⁶ floating-point operations (FLOPS) of compute. They must notify the state before releasing new or updated models, disclosing release dates, intended uses, and whether access will be open-source or via API. All developers must report catastrophic safety incidents within 15 days—or within 24 hours if lives are at risk. Larger firms with more than $500 million in annual revenue face additional obligations. They are required to publish and update safety frameworks, conduct catastrophic risk assessments and submit summaries to the California Office of Emergency Services, and implement strong cybersecurity to protect unreleased model weights. They must also maintain anonymous whistleblower channels, update them monthly, and provide quarterly summaries to senior leadership with protections against retaliation. The Attorney General can impose fines of up to $1 million per violation. The law has serious shortcomings: its blunt revenue threshold penalizes firms based on their size rather than their risk profiles, and its compute cut-off misses smaller but still capable models. But there are also important elements worth commending. Incident reporting is vital to post-deployment safety, which allows regulators to learn from real-world failures rather than relying solely on pre-release audits. Whistleblower protections are a simple and effective way to create legally protected channels for reporting imminent AI risks. And unlike its vetoed predecessor, SB 1047 —which would have required annual third-party audits against rigid safety mandates—this law takes a more flexible approach to transparency. By requiring firms to publish their own safety frameworks and submit high-level risk summaries to state officials, the law leans on public and market-facing pressures rather than solely on centralizing oversight in government oversight. That helps it avoid the trap Virginia has proposed , where routing everything through a single authority turns accountability into a paperwork exercise. Had these provisions appeared in a federal law on AI safety, their flaws might not have outweighed their value. One could reasonably argue for adjusting the revenue threshold to be size-neutral and for replacing crude compute cut-offs with capability-based criteria that could evolve. In that context, a federal statute with such elements could have still offered a net positive step toward more effective oversight of high-risk AI systems. But this is not a federal law. It is a state statute, and that changes the calculus entirely. No matter how measured or innovation-friendly the regulatory approach may appear in isolation, its merits collapse when applied through a single state because the law guarantees inconsistency across the country. California’s policymakers will argue that its outsized role—hosting 32 of the world’s 50 leading AI companies —creates de facto uniformity, but that assumption confuses where companies are headquartered with where they operate. Even if all 50 top firms were based in California, they would still have to comply with rules in every other state. And those states aren’t likely to adopt California’s approach wholesale, they’ll imitate the idea but not clone the details. Just as with privacy laws, AI safety statutes will diverge in scope, enforcement, and definitions, even while targeting the same problems. The result is fragmentation: a patchwork of conflicting obligations that forces companies into duplicative compliance and drains resources from innovation. There is no version of California’s AI safety law that can foster innovation nationally because state action on this topic creates fragmentation that harms innovation by definition. Proponents say this critique misses the point: of course AI should ideally be regulated federally, but in the absence of congressional action, someone must step in. California’s law explicitly allows for federal preemption, so state officials cast their statute as a bridge, holding the line on safety until Washington acts, while advancing provisions they want to see as a national policy floor. But if this truly is the logic, then it is self-defeating, because enacting California’s law undermines efforts by Congressional Democrats at getting these measures adopted nationally. The law doesn’t just provide a policy floor on substance; it anchors these provisions as the left-most position in the federal debate—the reference point against which Republicans will define how far they are willing to go. For Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), who is spearheading federal preemption efforts and rallying opposition to any national framework that takes its cues from Sacramento, the California law doesn’t pull the federal debate toward its model; it pushes the eventual compromise further away. Still, some will argue that compromise is a fantasy in today’s political climate, and that California’s assertiveness is therefore necessary. Even if one sympathises with that instinct, it fails to reckon with the nature of the issue. Mitigating catastrophic AI risks means not only shaping how frontier systems are developed, but identifying and responding when they are misused. State regulators cannot compel developers beyond their borders, nor can they govern how actors in other states use systems built within their own. Federal regulation is therefore necessary—not only to safeguard innovation, but for the authority to manage risks wherever they arise in the United States, the capacity to identify misuse where it occurs, and the credibility to advocate for those safeguards abroad. And on substance, the partisan gap is not nearly as wide as the politics suggest. If emerging Republican proposals from the House and the Senate echo the measures former Trump administration officials are advocating for, there is common ground on both sides of the aisle around transparency requirements for high-risk systems and disclosure of mitigation practices. And since the only realistic path to a durable federal AI law that preempts state measures is through Congress’s regular order, Republicans will need Democrats at the table. California’s ideas could strengthen global AI safety, but only if they are carried through a national framework. If Democrats want that to happen, they should resist the lure of short-term state wins that make a federal deal harder to reach. Republicans, for their part, should resist the reflex to dismiss the merits of these ideas, many of which echo their own calls to regulate realized rather than hypothetical harms. The key to success—for both innovation and safety—is lifting good ideas from both sides of the aisle and anchoring them in a bipartisan federal framework.

What Happened to the American Business Creed? Part I: Business Attacks Value Six: Democracy and Universalism Value Seven: Service and Social Responsibility Restoring the Creed,2025-10-02,Robert D. Atkinson,"In August, I wrote a blog about a 1956 book, The American Business Creed , and how strong and positive that creed was, as well as the key role it played in making America the strongest economy in the world. A reader asked if I would speculate on why what was generally accepted in the 1950s is now largely either ignored or demonized. So in this post, I will focus on the changes in business values stemming largely from changes in business itself. In a follow-on post, I will address broader social forces that launched a broad-scale attack on these values. Let me reiterate the book’s seven key U.S. business values: Individualism with moral responsibility and freedom Materialism and productivity Practical realism The continuing goal of progress The need for optimism and the spirit of adventure Democracy and universalism Service and social responsibility One can make a strong case that these values, held by American businesses and supported by most of U.S. society—including all but the most left-wing elites—were a key factor in enabling U.S. global economic leadership. Most large businesses still strongly support values one through five. However, the final two values have changed and weakened. Indeed, the values that have eroded the most, but by no means completely, relate to democracy and universalism and to service and social responsibility. The business creed insists on prioritizing the “welfare of all Americans” over the “welfare of humanity.” Today, however, globalization has shifted that balance. In the 1950s, while many companies sold in foreign markets, true multinationals had not yet emerged. That is why GM CEO Charles Erwin Wilson, known as ""Engine Charlie,” could tell the Senate that the interests of GM and the interests of the United States were aligned. At the time, this was seen as a perfectly reasonable statement. And when that was the case, a strong business meant a strong economy. But with the rise of global economic integration—enabled by technological changes like jet air travel, container ships, and improved communications—globalization became inevitable. Hence, for the growing number of multinationals, the welfare of humanity started to get more attention than the welfare of all Americans. As Geoffrey G. Jones of Harvard Business School wrote , “The view that global firms were becoming divorced from the nation state began to be widely expressed as the pace of globalization accelerated from the 1980s.” Interestingly, companies were supported by changes in American politics, both on the left and the right. The GOP, supported by leading free-market think tanks, became the party of free trade and globalization in the 1970s. But the left embraced globalization as well. Ever since the Bolshevik Revolution, the U.S. left has had mixed loyalties, often putting the interests of the global oppressed ahead of American interests. This became more pronounced in the last two decades, as more of the left adopted a globalist outlook in which loyalty shifted from “America first” to “the global proletariat first.” We see that with leading progressive economists like Joseph Stiglitz, who pushes for weak IP protection in the United States so that developing countries can pay less for U.S. intellectual property. While they might still hate corporations and despise capitalism, they (like multinationals) put global interests ahead of American ones. The creed says that business managers must support service to society. That commitment, once central, has steadily eroded in the aftermath of the shareholder-value movement. Corporate leaders in the 1950s firmly believed in service to the nation, embracing the notion that beyond earning profit they had a duty to advance society. To be sure, virtually all large U.S. corporations now have corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs. But these are largely add-ons rather than core components of the firm. And the more fundamental duty of business leaders is not supporting local charities or environmental programs, but ensuring the overall American capitalist system—and by extension the U.S. economy—is strong. On that measure, businesses embrace that role far less than they did 75 years ago. As U.C. Berkeley political scientist David Vogel wrote in his 1978 seminal article “Why Businessmen Distrust Their State: The Political Consciousness of American Corporate Executives”: As Vogel points out, because of the nature of capitalist development in the United States, where the state did not have to play a strong role in overthrowing feudal interests, U.S. business leaders never adopted a very strong role as “capitalists.” But even so, their understanding of that role declined significantly after the late 1970s. Before then, many business leaders saw themselves not only as businesspeople but also as corporate statesmen. CEOs like Reg Jones of General Electric, Irving Shapiro of DuPont, Thomas Watson of IBM, David Packard of HP, George Romney of American Motors, and even John Young of HP in the 1980s spent considerable time advancing the interests of the nation, not just their own firms. Unless you are a diehard anti-corporate advocate, there is little doubt that this advocacy strengthened America. But that began to diminish in the late 1970s and 1980s, prompted by the shareholder-value movement and libertarian notions of popular economic figures like Milton Friedman, who proclaimed that the only purpose of business is to maximize profits. At one level, this is of course true: Companies have to make profits or they cannot stay in business. But if support for the capitalist system weakens, and if policies to support it are weakened, then the ability to earn individual profits is also lessened. As Wall Street shifted from providing long-term capital for productive investment to a short-term extraction game—led by raiders like Mike Milken, Carl Icahn, Nelson Peltz, T. Boone Pickens, and others—CEOs could no longer afford anything but a focus on short-term profits. The capitalist system would have to take care of itself. At the same time, corporate norms shifted, and what was once a system that enabled and largely required statesmanship was now one that penalized it. The rise of intense global competition only reinforced this short-termism and narrow self-interest. As Doug Henwood wrote , “the transaction replaced the relationship—not just on Wall Street but in American business generally.” And relationships, it turns out, are critical to the effective functioning and strength of the U.S. economy. Finally, the decline of the traditional American WASP ruling class—which, for all its flaws, had the singular advantage of promoting leaders who were civic-minded and not only self-interested—played a key role. Say what you will about this class, it at least had an ethos of service to the nation. We saw this in the motto of private boarding school Groton, the leading training ground for the American leadership class before the 1950s: Cui servire est regnare , which is conventionally translated as “To serve is to rule.” In other words, service was expected, even if not always altruistic. Today, the WASPs are a timid minority that recognizes itself at its private country clubs, but not much more. It is beyond the scope of this post to discuss whether it is possible to restore business values to their pre-1970s state. But perhaps the most important step in that direction would be to recognize that the current system is not working as it should. The business creed of the 1950s helped make America the strongest economy in the world. Today, to maintain global economic leadership and prevail in the ongoing techno-economic war with China, the United States should revisit the two eroded values discussed. That means curbing the role of “casino finance” in the system and elevating the role of business leaders to that of statesmen.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/02/what-happened-to-the-american-business-creed-part-i-business-attacks/
Congress Needs to Shutdown-Proof CISA,2025-10-03,Daniel Castro,"Government shutdowns leave U.S. critical infrastructure dangerously exposed to cyberattacks. Congress needs to address this vulnerability immediately for the current shutdown, and take additional steps to protect the nation’s top cyber agency in future government shutdowns. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) furloughed two-thirds of its staff this week after Congress failed to pass a spending bill to keep the government open, leaving the agency with just shy of 900 workers. The CISA workforce had already shrunk earlier this year by approximately 1,000 workers in DOGE-related staffing cuts. CISA serves a vital function, not only providing cybersecurity leadership across the federal government and for states, but also working to secure critical infrastructure, including energy, transportation, and health-care systems, while responding to cyberattacks. So, these cuts have severely weakened the nation’s first line of cyber defense and grounded the teams that are on standby to respond to an attack. But the problem is bigger than just a lack of personnel at the nation’s cyber agency. Congress also failed to renew the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 ( CISA 2015 ), a law that shields private-sector companies from liability for collecting and sharing information about cyber threats . CISA 2015 allows companies to monitor private networks, share cyber threat intelligence with government agencies, and exchange information about cybersecurity issues with other companies without violating privacy or antitrust laws. The law expired on September 30, 2025, and while it has bipartisan support in Congress , the reauthorization has stalled as part of the current government funding fight. Without this law, the flow of information from the private sector about emerging cyber threats will come to a halt. Hitting pause on U.S. cybersecurity efforts creates a serious vulnerability. Chinese, Russian, and North Korean hackers regularly target U.S. businesses and government agencies. For example, the PRC-backed cyber group Volt Typhoon has compromised the systems of critical infrastructure organizations in the United States in a multitude of sectors, including communications, energy, transportation, and water. Attackers are savvy, and they will exploit any weakness. Following federal government layoffs earlier this year, a network of front companies for a Chinese firm tried to recruit former government workers in a likely attempt at intelligence gathering. Attackers will almost certainly seize this opening to attempt new exploits—ones that may not be discovered for months or more. In the short term, Congress would ideally move quickly to reauthorize CISA 2015 and fund CISA operations, even if the overall funding fight continues. But the reality is that lawmakers are unlikely to give any preferential treatment to CISA over other federal budget concerns, especially if Congress remains out of session. But these budget fights are becoming more common, so Congress should prepare for the next one. To keep CISA fully operational, Congress should create a dedicated funding stream so that the agency does not have to rely so heavily on appropriations. One option is for Congress to establish a working capital fund and then allow CISA to create a fee-for-service model for various cybersecurity services that it provides to states, such as vulnerability monitoring and phishing assessments. CISA provides these services at no cost today, but Congress could instead provide states grants to pay for these services from CISA. Another option would be for Congress to establish a permanent self-sustaining fund for CISA operations, such as one paid for with a small fee for domain name registrations and renewals. Maintaining strong cybersecurity is crucial to national security, and Congress should not allow it to get caught in the crossfire of funding fights. Unless Congress shutdown-proofs CISA, the next lapse in funding will not just stall government—it could open the door to dangerous cyberattacks by America’s adversaries.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/03/congress-needs-to-shutdown-proof-cisa/
"Comments to the European Commission on the Revision of EU Antitrust Procedures Introduction Improving the Effectiveness, Including the Speed, of Certain Aspects of the Commission’s Procedures in Digitised and Complex Investigations Policy Options Addressing Risks of Fragmented Competition Law Enforcement in Relation to Stricter National Laws on Unilateral Conduct Conclusion Endnotes",2025-10-02,Joseph V. Coniglio; Lilla Nóra Kiss,"On July 10, 2025, the European Commission (Commission) launched a call for evidence and public consultation on the revision to its antitrust procedural regulations, specifically Regulation 1/2003 and its implementing regulation, Regulation 773/2004.” [1] This followed the issuance of a working document in September 2024 which summarized the findings regarding the workings of the antitrust procedural regulations and found that while the regulations were generally effective, issues remained about the importance of ensuring uniform competition law standards across the European Union (EU), as well as the need for faster and more efficient investigations. [2] In its Call for Evidence For An Impact Assessment, the Commission outlined several proposed options to address these concerns upon which interested stakeholders could provide feedback. [3] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the world’s top-ranked science and technology policy think tank, greatly appreciates the opportunity to respond to the Commission’s call for evidence. In general, ITIF believes that the antitrust procedural framework can be improved by measures that create a less burdensome and more objective evidentiary process, as well as provide investigated parties with greater access to the Commission’s complete file. Moreover, to avoid fragmentation, ITIF believes it is pivotal that the Commission expand its well-established convergence rule into the area of unilateral conduct, as well as consider other measures that prevent overreach by national competition authorities. Both Option 1—which would introduce an independent and self-standing power for the Commission to adopt decisions ordering the preservation of digital and physical information—and Option 2—which would adapt the existing Commission inspection power so that it is independent from the power to enter physical premises and means of transport, and adapt the power to conduct inspections so that it covers all business records regardless of the storage location of the data—would unnecessarily expand the Commission’s investigatory powers and create costs that are likely to far outweigh any evidentiary benefits. Specifically, whereas Option 1 would open the door to overly burdensome information preservation requests, Option 2 appears to sanction a problematic extraterritorial application of the Commission’s procedural rules. By contrast, Option 3 provides a much less onerous way for the Commission to gather additional and timely information, provided that all basic procedural due process protections are given to witnesses. Rather than reduce burdens for the Commission to implement interim measures, as Option 1 contemplates, the Commission should prioritize reforms, such as Option 2, that incentivize final and consensual resolutions between the Commission and an investigated party. Moreover, to foster more effective enforcement, the Commission should take steps to ensure that the factual record examined by a reviewing court is the product of objective evidentiary standards rather than the mere exercise of the Commission’s discretion as to what is included. For example, the Commission should consider adopting a standard whereby all relevant, material, and reliable evidence is admitted into the record unless its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or other similar prudential considerations. ITIF believes that the Commission should prioritize greater access to file procedures while also minimizing the procedural burden on investigated parties. While Option 1 would give third parties greater access to file procedures, it would come at a cost to investigated parties, who would have to produce a significantly greater number of non-confidential materials. By contrast, whereas Option 2 would not appear to result in similar burdens on investigated parties, it limits confidential file access to external advisors. As an additional option, the Commission should consider ways to give greater access to the confidential file to investigated parties’ in-house counsel, which would allow them to better understand the grounds for the Commission’s case without imposing any increased burdens associated with having to make extensive redactions for third parties. The concern about regulatory capture—here, third parties influencing competition law enforcement—and resultant false positives could be mitigated to the extent that, through Option 1, the Commission is not forced to issue a rejection decision to all formal complainants. By contrast, Option 2’s idea of harmonizing the rights of interested third parties with complainants risks increasing false negatives by disincentivizing the bringing of formal complaints by allowing third parties to free-ride on the efforts of complainants. The Commission’s proposal in Option 1 to adapt the existing coordination and information exchange mechanisms between competition authorities under Regulation 1/2003 so that these cover the application of stricter national laws on unilateral conduct in order to ensure the coherent, effective and complementary enforcement of available competition law instruments is not sufficient to counteract the risk of fragmentation posed by stricter national laws on unilateral conduct. As an alternative, the Commission should consider ways for it to more decisively engage with national competition authorities on the implementation of stricter laws surrounding unilateral conduct that include, where appropriate, having the final power to define remedies that are consistent with community-wide competition law standards. Indeed, with respect to unilateral conduct enforcement by member states in digital markets, this is particularly important in view of the Digital Markets Act and its ex ante approach to competition enforcement. The Commission’s proposal in Option 2 to discontinue the current system as described under section B is consistent with these broader concerns about an inadequate ability for the Commission to prevent fragmentation amidst increasingly strict enforcement of unilateral conduct laws by national competition authorities, particularly in the digital markets that the Commission is now regulating. As such, rather than attempt to modify its existing procedural framework, the Commission should clearly and definitively extend its convergence rule in Article 3(2) of Regulation 1/2003, which currently applies to concerted practices, to national laws proscribing unilateral conduct. Ensuring that Article 102’s already stringent abuse of dominance standards constitute a ceiling for unilateral conduct liability in Europe will not only limit fragmentation but also likely lead to a reduction in false positives by reducing overzealous enforcement at the member state level—ultimately benefiting European consumers and innovation. The revision of Europe’s antitrust procedural regulations presents an opportunity to strengthen the internal market by promoting enforcement that is more coherent, proportionate, and efficient. We urge the Commission to adopt a procedural design that minimizes burdens on, and increases access to, investigated parties, as well as drives greater uniformity in European unilateral conduct enforcement. Thank you for your consideration.

The Industrial Skyline: Turning China’s Old Factories into Cultural Spaces,,,,,https://www.rprealtyplus.com/international/the-industrial-skyline-turning-chinas-old-factories-into-cultural-spaces-122075.html
Trump’s H-1B Visa Plan Will Backfire,2025-10-02,Robert D. Atkinson,"MAGA Republicans have long criticized the H-1B visa program, arguing it takes jobs away from American workers. So it wasn’t surprising when President Trump issued a proclamation requiring any organization petitioning to employ an H-1B worker to pay $100,000—a de facto ban. But as Robert Atkinson argues in Washington Monthly , this approach won’t protect U.S. workers. Instead, it will push U.S. tech firms to hire more workers overseas, worsen the trade balance by eroding America’s surplus in service exports, and leave U.S. companies less competitive than foreign counterparts, including Chinese firms. While opponents of the H-1B program base their critique on faulty assumptions, studies show H-1B employees tend to earn slightly more than their U.S. peers, raise wages at their firms, and help companies grow without displacing native-born workers. Atkinson explains the real problem is that the United States simply isn’t producing enough STEM graduates to meet soaring demand, in large part due to weaknesses in the U.S. education system. If the president is worried about firms bypassing skilled Americans, Atkinson proposes a better solution: Congress should allow the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to auction off the 85,000 H-1B visa slots available each year. Companies that truly need foreign talent would pay the price, while others would hire Americans instead—ensuring the United States attracts top global talent without undercutting domestic workers. Given the world’s population, the sheer volume of talent outside the U.S. is larger than inside it. Restricting visas will only limit access to the best and brightest, resulting in fewer U.S. jobs and weaker U.S. companies.

Get the FCC Out of the Censorship Business,2025-10-02,Joe Kane,"FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr has invoked the “public interest” standard to threaten broadcasters who air political commentary he dislikes—most recently Jimmy Kimmel’s remarks about Charlie Kirk. But as Joe Kane argues in City Journal , Carr’s approach misrepresents the law and endangers free speech. Kane explains that while the FCC regulates broadcasters’ technical operations, it cannot use license renewals to punish political expression. The Supreme Court has repeatedly limited the “public interest” standard, and any attempt to weaponize it for partisan ends would violate both the Communications Act and the First Amendment. Carr’s threats, Kane warns, reflect a broader misunderstanding of the FCC’s authority. Congress never gave the Commission power to police speech—and doing so would set a dangerous precedent for government censorship of political discourse.

China’s EV Supremacy Raises National Security Concerns for the US,,,"The electric vehicle revolution is often framed as a climate imperative—a way to cut carbon emissions and slow global warming. But the race to electrify automotive fleets is not just about the transportation sector: EVs are the gateway to a new military -industrial era. And China is already winning. While the U.S. dithers over charging stations and trade restrictions, China has built a vertically integrated EV empire—dominating production, supply chains and the underlying technologies that will define the next century. This isn’t just about cars. It’s about batteries that power everything from smartphones to drones to autonomous weapons. It means building the kind of deep R&D pipelines that can be redirected toward military technologies. It means dominance in AI navigation, robotics and smart cities. It’s about who will control the infrastructure of the future—and who could win future wars. “A healthy, innovative auto sector drives industrial power far beyond cars,” David Feith, former deputy assistant secretary at the State Department, told Newsweek . “It’s crucial for scale and the downstream flow of innovations.” Today’s Chinese EVs are computers on wheels, equipped for the digital age with infotainment systems and touchscreens and high-tech features like rotating passenger seats and a weird gimmick that lets cars “dance” or shake to music. Some models even sport a roof-mounted drone that motorists can launch off the car to record video by remote control. If America fails to lead (or even compete) in the EV space, it won’t just miss its climate targets—it will forfeit its industrial base, hollow out its manufacturing heartland and turn Detroit , once the symbol of American ingenuity, into a legacy domestic supplier of gasoline-powered pickups. In short, the United States stands to lose the technological edge that made it a superpower while the rest of the world zooms past. “If the U.S. doesn’t invest in new mobility innovations, hundreds of thousands of jobs and market share will vanish for good, along with a major shift in wealth,” warned Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. The EV race is not just a matter of mobility. It’s about sovereignty. China’s bold move into electric vehicles began in 2009 as a top-down policy to compete with foreign automakers, cut air pollution and reduce oil imports. Spurred by subsidies and incentives and its vast industrial production capabilities, China leapfrogged over manufacturing gasoline-powered cars and rocketed to become the world’s largest EV manufacturer with more than 70 percent of global production today, according to the International Energy Agency. Electric car sales are set to exceed 20 million vehicles worldwide this year; China will make 14 million or two-thirds of them. The next EV leap is expected by 2030, the IEA forecasts, when EVs reach 40 percent of total auto sales globally. But in 2024, EVs were already more than half of autos sold in China and could reach 60 percent this year. By comparison, in the U.S., one in 10 cars sold were EVs in 2024, IEA figures show, and only modest growth is expected this decade. Even so, the U.S. still depends on its conventional auto industry as an anchor to both economic and geopolitical might. After all, auto factories supplied weapons during World War II and still could. Absent action by American leadership to narrow the EV gap with China by investing in its own competitiveness, China’s scale and velocity in industrial tech and support of EV adoption could cause U.S. automakers to become “increasingly irrelevant,” technology forecaster Paul Saffo told Newsweek . “If the U.S. doesn’t transition to new energy vehicles quickly,” said auto industry expert Michael Dunne of Dunne Insights, “Detroit will cede the global market and be reduced to a niche supplier of gas-powered pickup trucks and SUVs.” The hard truth? “We are sitting on an island of ICE [internal combustion engines], rapidly moving back into the 1950s of Detroit with big boomer cars while the rest of the world is moving forward with electric vehicles,” said John Zysman, professor emeritus at UC Berkeley and cofounder and codirector of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. It may be too late to push back the march of Chinese EVs. China’s appealing and cost-competitive electric cars are gaining substantial market share in European markets like the U.K. and France and are up to 85 percent of EV sales in Brazil and nearly two-thirds in Mexico . Such growth is fueled by China’s low labor costs, well-developed component supply chain, fiercely competitive and crowded manufacturing sector and government subsidies, which have combined to lower average EV prices by about 10 percent over the last five years to about $26,000, on par with ICE vehicles. Rather than trying to keep up, the U.S. is increasingly trying to keep China’s EVs out. This year, the U.S. restricted the import and sale of Chinese internet-connected electric vehicles citing national security concerns, such as spying on drivers, recording images of infrastructure or transmitting data back to Beijing . The Biden administration announced more than $170 billion worth of investments to foster domestic EV auto production. But now, the outlook for EVs in the U.S. has dimmed due to recent policy shifts under President Donald Trump. The One Big Beautiful Bill eliminated the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, and after Trump’s pause on a $5 billion program for states to build out their electric charging station networks was overturned by the courts, the future of the program remains uncertain. Ineffective policies for the EV market could mirror the loss of the solar energy industry, says Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, where too-late action left America outpaced and China controlling more than 80 percent of the world’s solar panels. If the U.S. poorly manages the transition to EVs, it could trigger high unemployment and poverty in Rust Belt and Sun Belt manufacturing hubs. EVs have fewer parts than gasoline engines and automated assembly plants don’t need as many workers. They also don’t need the same workers: EV factory employees need to be proficient in running electrical systems, safely handling high-voltage components and programming and maintaining robots—not exactly Henry Ford ’s assembly line operators. In the 20th century, America’s dominance of the private car industry reshaped its economy, landscape, cities and global influence. The individually owned automobile made possible by Ford’s advances in mass production in the early part of the century unlocked the forces that transformed the country following World War II, including encouraging workforce mobility, fueling suburban expansion, catalyzing the steel and petroleum industries and supercharging consumer culture. “The leapfrog of the American economy in the past was because of private cars,” Uri Levine, cofounder of Waze, told Newsweek . That dominance didn’t just build wealth—it built geopolitical power. Today, China is replicating that model with electric vehicles, and the second-order benefits are already cascading: smarter cities, stronger supply chains and a growing lead in AI navigation, robotics and battery technology. If the U.S. fails to keep pace, it won’t just lose the EV market—it will lose the foundation for the next generation of industrial and military innovation. “Now, as U.S. mobility innovations stall, we are starting to get stuck, and that is going to slow us down economically,” Levine warned. China’s huge industrial market and modernized infrastructure provide an unparalleled base for its EVs to go mainstream. Chinese EV brands outdo gas-powered vehicles on driving distance and some new models are almost as fast at refueling, with batteries that can be swapped out in under five minutes. This lead is driven by China’s extensive electric charging network, with nearly 10 million charging stations as of May 2025 and growing 56 percent year-on-year, according to the National Development and Reform Commission. This year, Beijing alone plans to build 1,000 ultra-fast charging stations, which can provide 250 miles of driving in a five-minute stop, while the megacity Chongqing is adding 4,000 ultra-fast chargers. By contrast, the U.S. has approximately 76,000 charging stations, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, with Tesla accounting for 54 percent of fast chargers and building out more supercharger sites with multiple ports, two of them in California . As China’s climb with EVs continues, this knowhow has spilled over into other next-generation industries. “Over the past 15 years, China has climbed the value chain—starting with electronics then leveraging that expertise to expand and capture more global production,” Robert D. Atkinson, founder of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, told Newsweek . “Economists call this cumulative causation: Gains in one sector fuel advances in others. That’s exactly what the Chinese have been doing.” This domino effect could lead China to leverage its dominance in EVs to yield innovations ahead of the West. For instance, EV maker NIO, boosted by investments from Chinese province Anhui, developed battery-swapping stations to exchange depleted batteries for recharged ones within minutes. Modeled on mobile data plans, subscription plans for battery-as-a-service for leased EV batteries have sprung up in China. In the electrified city of the future, parking spaces could be converted into lots for ridesharing and robotaxis, supercharging stations and dedicated bike lanes, said Kara Kockelman, professor of transportation engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Increased adoption of EVs leads to more autonomous driving shuttles, better urban planning, reduced traffic congestion and less air pollution. This future is already arriving in digitized cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen. Thanks to China’s favorable governmental policies, scale and a robust infrastructure, compared with a fragmented regulatory and hesitant approach in the U.S., China stands to also gain a competitive advantage in the autonomous vehicle market and the AI navigation capabilities to power it, said John Helveston, an associate professor at George Washington University’s engineering management department. Baidu’s Apollo Go, a Chinese autonomous driving leader, has rolled out robotaxi services across many Chinese cities, far ahead of the progress of Alphabet’s Waymo, the primary player in the U.S., while General Motors canceled its money-losing Cruise robotaxi service in 2024. Tesla is still in the early stages of testing. “Five years from now, I’d bet on a Chinese company figuring out how to make a fully autonomous car that can out-compete even Waymo today because there’s this industrial ecosystem all around it,” Helveston predicted. Whatever the future standards are for EVs, it will be the market leader who sets them. This is already playing out with the technical charging standards for electric plugs. Currently, the North American standard is modeled on the Tesla charge post, which GM, Ford, Rivian and other U.S. automakers have adopted. Europe requires a different standard for fast charging. China has its own ultra-fast system, which Tesla relies on for the Chinese market. Meanwhile, a new high-power plug with a lightweight, smaller connector design, called ChaoJi, is being tested in China and Japan. China’s vast EV market and extended supply chain network provides the additional benefit of vertical integration. Chinese EV leader BYD, for example, has streamlined operations by bringing parts for assembly under one factory roof, which can improve quality control and speed up R&D cycles. BYD even owns a shipping fleet of six vessels which can each carry 9,200 vehicles, providing better control of the timing and costs of its distribution routes. It’s been a generation—36 years—since Ford operated a shipping fleet, and that was for transporting iron and coal across the Great Lakes to Dearborn, Michigan. Another advantage for China in this new EV age: It is technology entrepreneurs, not incumbent automakers, who are leading the industry’s disruptive changes. EV makers like Xiaomi (which first made smartphones), XPENG and NIO began as tech startups during China’s internet boom of the 2010s. Supported by leading private equity investors from China and the West, they raised large amounts of capital, went public on Hong Kong and New York exchanges and carved out strong leads in China. By contrast, GM and Ford have joint ventures with Chinese partners that are often state-owned enterprises established some 25 years ago, and today, are experiencing shrinking influence and market shares. A pressing issue in the realm of EVs is dual-use technologies for commercial and military purposes. “Military-civil fusion has exploded in recent years with the evolution of technology,” national security expert Feith explained, and advances in commercial sectors can feed directly into defense capabilities. Leadership in batteries, robotics and automation brings economies of scale and deep R&D pipelines that can be redirected toward military use. “Today, the United States is increasingly reliant on foreign adversaries for the minerals, technologies and supply chains that will drive economic growth, enhance energy security and strengthen the national defense,” retired Admiral Jonathan Greenert, co-chair of SAFE’s Energy Security Leadership Council, wrote in a recent report, “The Pillars of Power.” “The stakes could not be higher. The decisions made today will determine whether the United States reasserts and secures its position as the world’s leading economic and technological power or continues to cede ground in industries critical to its future,” he concluded, urging coordinated action to restore America’s industrial base, secure critical supply chains, modernize the electric gird and strengthen national defense through energy and technological leadership to avoid future trade and tech conflicts reminiscent of Middle East regimes’ leverage over oil. China has gained a lead in batteries and is aiming for dominance in robotics and next-generation AI-powered manufacturing. The battlefield applications of these fields are already being demonstrated. Drones equipped with advanced batteries and sensors can fly longer, avoid obstacles and maneuver into swarm tactics that can win battles, such as with Ukraine’s recent coordinated, long-range drone attack into Russia known as “Spider Web.” EV self-driving systems can be adapted for military use to autonomously guide unmanned tanks, transport supplies and patrol areas. Efficient, high-torque electric motors can be repurposed for precise navigation and dexterity for military strikes. Sensors and AI technologies used in connected passenger vehicles can be transferred to use in warfare to improve battlefield monitoring and navigation of military equipment. The batteries that power next-generation military technologies—drones, humanoid robots, AI navigation—are at the heart of the U.S.-China competition for industrial and technological leadership. Drones and batteries are currently dominated by giant Chinese tech companies: Shenzhen-based drone maker DJI, privately held and largely owned by its billionaire founder Frank Wang, and Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited, or CATL, an EV-focused battery spinoff of the Japanese electronics giant TDK founded by Robin Zeng. U.S. fears that DJI drones could beam sensitive images back to China previously led to a ban on their use in the U.S. military . The Commerce Department has choked off its supply of U.S. chips and sensors, and the Treasury has blacklisted the firm from American investment. And yet, DJI accounts for 70 percent of global drone sales. Located in Fujian province, CATL is the world’s largest maker of lithium-ion batteries and supplies Tesla and Volkswagen in China. CATL claims roughly half of China’s battery market and more than one-third worldwide, and it’s now pushing into the U.S., raising concerns about a Chinese supplier that can power everything from EVs to defense systems. Achieving cost parity with China for batteries requires production at scale, and that scale depends on strong, sustained demand for EVs, the largest battery consumer. Without it, the U.S. risks relying heavily on China for the very power source that underpins future technologies critical to national security and defense. “This would mean deep reliance on, and vulnerability to, China,” said Dunne. CATL recently struck a licensing deal with Ford to supply battery technology for a new $3.5 billion Ford-owned plant in Michigan. The move quickly drew scrutiny from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party , which questioned Ford’s reliance on Chinese technology, minerals and workers. CATL’s U.S. ambitions face another hurdle: In January, the Pentagon blacklisted the company over alleged ties to China’s military—a charge CATL denies. China’s dominance in electric vehicles is also boosting its robotics sector. While the U.S. has achieved an early lead in robotics innovation, it lags in large-scale production with no U.S. firm currently mass-producing industrial robots. Meanwhile China, which has widely deployed robotics in its vast manufacturing sector, announced a $138 billion investment in robotics and AI under its Made in China 2025 policy aiming to close the technical gap and establish itself as a global leader in advanced manufacturing. Ultimately, America’s culture of innovation is a decisive advantage that China has struggled to replicate. Chinese engineers excel at copying and refining Western advances, but true disruptive invention remains harder to come by. Beijing is catching up, as shown by the sudden rise of AI startup DeepSeek. In this massive auto industry shift, GM and Ford vehicles are holding on to global market shares of about 9 percent and 6 percent. Quite the change from the 1960s, when the Big Three automakers dominated and China made hardly any cars. Today in China, American-made gas-powered models—a source of profits and access to suppliers for U.S. automakers—are quickly being sidelined in the world’s fastest-growing EV market. In 2024, GM sales in China dropped 14 percent and, for the first nine months of the year, its market share there declined from 8.6 percent to 6.8 percent, down from 15 percent in the mid-2010s. In the first six months of 2025, the automaker posted a rebound, with sales rising 9.4 percent, boosted by momentum in its new energy vehicles. However, a shake-out is coming in China’s dynamic EV market. More than 100 brands currently compete with one another, leading to steep discounts and price wars. Only 15 Chinese EV makers are expected to emerge from this boom, predicts consultancy AlixPartners. Not surrendering, in the U.S., GM and Ford have pledged upward of $90 billion to build battery plants and convert old factories that will begin operating within three to five years—a long time in the fast-moving EV market. The Detroit automakers have enjoyed some notable EV wins in pickups (F-150 and Silverado) and SUVs (Equinox and Mustang Mach EV). Tesla has been in a sales slump this year but still claims about half of EV sales in the U.S. And don’t count out America’s world-leading culture of innovation. Two San Diego-based firms, South 8 Technologies and UNIGRID, have each landed $12 million in strategic funding and dozens of patents for longer-lasting, faster-charging battery technologies that could accelerate the adoption of EVs. Tesla had a first-mover advantage in China in 2013, leveraging the government’s support of EVs with subsidies and incentives and its production base and opening a gigafactory in Shanghai in 2019. China became Tesla’s number one market in sales and its biggest production and export hub. Tesla is still regarded by the Chinese as a premium brand, and its Model 3, at around $33,000, is pricier than comparable Chinese makes such as the Xiaomi SU7 sedan at $30,400. But Tesla has recently been discounting in the highly competitive Chinese market as well. And its prestige image started to fade as snazzy new Chinese EV makers emerged and Tesla’s lineup needed a refresher (a new, roomier six-seater Model Y had a successful launch in August). While chalking up 8.8 percent growth last year, Tesla’s share of the Chinese market fell to 6 percent down from 15 percent in 2020. Moreover BYD, which Warren Buffett had backed in 2008, surpassed Tesla as the top global EV seller in 2024 and keeps widening its sales lead. “The Chinese EV makers are advanced and are innovating at the cutting edge, and Tesla needs to be able to keep up with that,” said China and tech policy expert Paul Triolo, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based business advisory firm DGA Group. “China has an advantage because they have the supply chain for EVs, particularly rare earth minerals and batteries—and a big advantage in costs.” There are still plenty of unknowns about the progression of EV technology. Other disruptive technologies of the future could dent their incline. “It’s quixotic to believe that electric will be the model of all vehicles,” said tech futurist George Gilder, adding that he foresees “a strong role for emerging renewable energy, hydrogen-powered vehicles.” However, the second-order impacts of a global automotive realignment are already playing out. Shortages of rare earth minerals idled Detroit production lines earlier this year and only eased after the U.S. made a deal with China to lift export restrictions of certain chip design software. To avoid further supply line pinches like this, GM recently struck a long-term deal with Noveon Magnetics, whose San Marcos, Texas, facility is the only rare earth magnet manufacturer in the United States. Over the past two decades, China has risen from imitator to innovator, advancing rapidly in new energy, robotics, batteries and drones—and related military power. “We can’t block China from technology,” Jim McGregor, chairman of APCO Worldwide, Greater China, told Newsweek . “We can slow them down a bit, but we need to figure out how to get along and de-risk it.” Correction, 10/01/25, 02:05 PM ET: This article was updated to accurately quote Erik Gordon.",,https://www.newsweek.com/chinas-ev-supremacy-raises-national-security-concerns-for-the-us-10799968
Comments to the European Commission Regarding the European Innovation Act Introduction Limitations of the Current Proposal Recommendations Conclusion Endnotes,2025-10-03,Stephen Ezell; Ayesha Bhatti; Rodrigo Balbontin,"Contents Introduction . 1 Limitations of the Current Proposal 3 Recommendations 4 Conclusion . 11 Endnotes 11 The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit these comments in response to the European Commission’s call for evidence on the Commission’s proposed European Innovation Act (EIA). [1] ITIF is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy think tank, committed to articulating and advancing pro-productivity, pro-innovation, and pro-technology public policy agendas around the world to spur growth, prosperity, and progress. The European Commission should take bold steps to reverse Europe’s declining competitiveness. As a forthcoming ITIF analysis of the OECD’s Trade in Value Added Data series will show, for 10 major advanced industries (e.g., computers and semiconductors), the EU’s share of global value added fell from 22 percent in 2000 to just 16 percent in 2022, and its location quotient (a measure of specialization relative to the rest of the world) has remained about average, falling from 3 percent above the relative global average to 2 percent above par. The EU 17 fell from 4 percent above average to 1 percent above average. [2] Moreover, from 2005 to 2024, Europe’s share of global economic output fell from roughly 33 percent to 23 percent, meaning that Europe’s share of the global economy is now likely the lowest it’s been since the Middle Ages. [3] Something is going wrong. Without a decisive course correction, Europe will continue to fall further behind the global pace. The EIA aims to create an innovation-friendly environment that supports the growth of innovative companies in the EU. ITIF welcomes this initiative—it outlines how to address innovation constraints that are long overdue in Europe. However, the European Commission cannot rely solely on the EIA to close its competitiveness gap. While the EIA correctly identifies barriers such as a challenging regulatory environment, limited access to capital, and insufficient late-stage support for scaling projects, it focuses too narrowly on the startup ecosystem. By doing so, the EIA misses the structural competitiveness issues that undercut Europe’s innovation capacity . For the EIA to succeed, the Commission needs to address Europe’s broader economic policy environment. The EU’s reliance on the precautionary principle has entrenched a risk-first mindset that slows innovation and diverts resources away from competition and quality improvement. For example, the overreliance on the precautionary principle will hinder Europe’s adoption and diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI), as it increases costs, lowers product quality, and reduces consumer options. [4] Europe’s innovation capacity faces a geopolitical dimension that the Commission should both acknowledge and address. Europe’s weakening competitiveness increases its vulnerability to the West’s strategic rival, China . European champions now lag Chinese competitors in key sectors such as automobiles and telecommunications equipment, weakening Europe’s long-term economic security. [5] To combat the stated problems above, ITIF recommends that the European Commission: 1. Use the innovation principle as the guideline for EU digital regulation. 2. Establish an Office of Innovation Review to serve as an “innovation advocate” within the EU. 3. Establish a “28th Regime.” 4. Increase the commercialization capacity of European universities. 5. Implement a “Bayh-Dole Act-like” framework governing university ownership of intellectual property (IP) derived from public research and development (R&D) funding. 6. Deepen pools of risk capital, in part by permitting pension funds to invest in venture capital. 7. Increase the continent’s R&D intensity to at least 3 percent. The Commission’s assessment of the roots of the European innovation deficit is incomplete. The EIA correctly identifies regulatory burdens, lack of access to capital, and insufficient support for phases close to commercialization as innovation constraints for EU companies. Yet, these reforms do not tackle the core causes of the EU’s competitiveness lag. The EIA proposal does little to address its identified regulatory burdens head-on, preserving the EU’s traditional regulatory stance that impedes taking risks and the dispersed markets that constrain access to capital and a large market to scale. The EIA fails to challenge the precautionary principle, which prioritizes hypothetical risks over tangible benefits, that underpins Europe’s regulatory framework by forming part of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). [6] Whilst the TFEU frames the precautionary principle within environmental policy, a communication by the EU on the principle clarified that, in practice, it applies far beyond this, to include all aspects of consumer policy. [7] As such, the precautionary principle guides many consumer protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation, Digital Markets Act, Digital Services Act, and Artificial Intelligence Act. [8] These laws raise compliance costs and delay time-to-market, diverting resources away from competition and quality improvement. The EIA proposal insufficiently supports innovation across the regulatory pipeline, failing to acknowledge the Regulatory Scrutiny Board (RSB)’s latest reports on the EU’s Better Regulation initiative which serves to simplify regulatory burdens and facilitate compliance so that innovations can reach European markets quicker. Without fundamental changes to address the EU’s growing innovation deficit, the EU will continue to fall into global irrelevance, and risk becoming a vassal state to its strategic competitors. Mario Draghi himself called for the use of economic statecraft to assert European freedom. [9] A coherent competitiveness strategy that leverages innovation to boost Europe’s strategic industries is therefore integral to the EU’s survival. ITIF offers the following policy recommendations to boost Europe’s innovation capacity. The European Commission should replace the precautionary principle with the innovation principle as the guideline for its digital regulations. The precautionary principle calls for regulations to pre-emptively mitigate potential risks, even when there is no evidence of harm. While this approach is intended to protect consumers, in practice, it often results in restrictive frameworks that slow innovation and increase compliance costs with little to no benefit. By contrast, the innovation principle—a policy to promote innovation for environmental, social, and economic objectives and harness future technological advances—offers an alternative approach that better balances risk mitigation with technological opportunity. [10] The innovation principle currently sits within the EU’s Better Regulation initiative, both of which require reform that the Commission should address in its EIA proposal. The EU initially introduced the Better Regulation initiative to guide the development of regulation to reduce complexity and burdens. [11] The initiative aims to simplify and better implement regulation to enable European competitiveness, detailing guidelines and tools that the European Commission can use to achieve these aims. For example, the initiative includes a mandatory competitiveness check for every regulation proposed by the European Commission, and a voluntary consideration of the innovation principle, both intended to ensure regulation does not hamper European competitiveness and innovation. In practice, however, these tools fall short: assessments are often inconsistent, poor quality, and fail to realize the full potential of the Better Regulation framework. [12] Moreover, the European Parliament has little awareness of the innovation principle, which severely limits its utility. [13] The European Commission should seize the opportunity presented by the EIA to correct this imbalance, embedding competitiveness and innovation directly into the policymaking process. The Commission should start by reforming existing Better Regulation tools rather than layering on additional, siloed checks. For example, the current mandatory competitiveness check assesses against four key metrics: cost and price competitiveness, capacity to innovate, international competitiveness, and SME competitiveness. In practice, most competitiveness assessments focus on the internal market and SME impact, with insufficient clarity as to which level of competitiveness the Commission is assessing, such as at EU, Member State, regional, sectoral, or firm level. [14] Such an approach reinforces a “pro-SME culture,” and an inward-looking, inconsistent approach to competitiveness. The Commission should reform the competitiveness check metrics to mandate equal consideration of all costs. First, to ensure size-neutral innovation policy, the Commission should replace its “SME competitiveness” check with a broader “firm competitiveness” check to ensure regulation does not affect the necessary contributions of larger firms’ innovation to the EU. Second, the Commission should require all competitiveness checks to identify any direct or indirect links between regulatory measures and competitiveness drivers such as productivity, as recommended by the RSB that assesses the functioning of the Better Regulation framework. [15] Similarly, the European Commission should replace the precautionary principle with the innovation principle as the key guiding principle for EU policymaking, ensuring that considerations of competitiveness and innovation are not the sole responsibility of the Commission, but rather are integrated into all aspects of the policymaking process. Placing innovation at the very foundation of the EU, such as within the TFEU, would oblige all EU institutions to focus on tangible benefits when assessing proposed legislation. Such an approach would provide the balance needed to protect Europe’s citizens while also enabling innovation to flourish. In order to ensure a more innovation-focused approach to regulation, the European Commission should establish an Office of Innovation Review (OIR) within the RSB to serve as an “innovation advocate” in the EU’s regulatory process. [16] Too often, regulatory review bodies focus on short-term, static effects—such as whether a rule will raise immediate costs—while overlooking longer-term, dynamic impacts on innovation. Indeed, in 2023, the RSB itself called for better, more consistent assessments by the European Commission to link regulation to competitiveness drivers. [17] A dedicated office within the RSB, but with authority to assess not just the European Commission but any EU regulatory actions that affect innovation, would provide the level of consistency needed to realise the EU’s innovation and competitiveness goals. The OIR would have the authority to push agencies to either actively promote innovation or achieve regulatory objectives in ways that are least harmful to innovation. The Commission should also ensure that this office embeds four core principles into regulatory decision-making: prioritizing innovation as a driver of competitiveness, ensuring risk mitigation measures are based on concrete evidence of harm, supporting innovation at every firm size, and reducing compliance costs that stifle growth. Embedding these principles consistently across policymaking would send a clear signal that the Commission is serious about making Europe a competitive place to innovate. At the same time, when the Commission proposes regulations that would clearly advance digital innovation, such as mandating the free flow of data within the EU, the RSB should not require an assessment of employment impacts, as this effectively penalizes rules that deliver higher productivity. At a minimum, if employment effects are measured, the RSB should also assess expected productivity and wage gains to offer a balanced assessment. By taking these steps, the European Commission would give businesses confidence that it understands the building blocks of successful innovation policy. Establishing an OIR within the RSB would not only reduce unnecessary barriers but also create the conditions for European firms to take risks, compete, and grow. The Commission should also consider that smart deregulation can be an enabler of innovation. A recent report from the Global Trade and Innovation Policy Alliance (GTIPA) highlights examples from multiple European countries of how smart deregulation can unleash innovation in high-tech industries. [18] For instance, Germany promoted online pharmacy competition by removing restrictions on mail-order medicine sales and Italy focused on procedural simplifications to accelerate broadband deployment. [19] Europe’s lack of a common market means European innovators suffer from considerable regulatory fragmentation, as companies must navigate 27 different sets of laws, taxes, administrative rules, etc. when they do business beyond their home country. [20] Accordingly, Europe should introduce a so-called “28th Regime” that would help European startups scale more efficiently across the continent. It would allow startup firms to: ▪ Incorporate once, and have that status recognized across the whole EU; ▪ Manage taxes, governance, and reporting through a single digital window; ▪ Hire employees, issue stock options, and raise funds across borders more seamlessly without necessitating legal representation or advice in each country; ▪ Startups would be able to incorporate directly under the 28th Regime, with no requirement for a multi-country footprint before formation. [21] Critically, a 28th Regime wouldn’t supplant or obviate an individual nation’s corporate laws, it would simply provide an alternative pathway for startup companies to incorporate and operate across the European Union. Like the United States, Europe needs to do a better job at transforming scientific R&D funding into new commercialized innovations in Europe. One way to advance this would be to require that recipients of R&D funding grants under the Horizon Europe program submit a one-pager explaining the potential for technological commercialization of the science they’re examining under the R&D research. One reason the United States has come to lead the world in innovation is that it has transformed its universities into engines of innovation. [22] In fact, from 1996 to 2020, academic technology transfer activities resulted in 554,000 inventions disclosed, 141,000 U.S. patents granted, and 18,000 start-ups formed. [23] This activity has bolstered U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) by up to $1 trillion and contributed to $1.9 trillion in gross U.S. industrial output. America’s successful academic technology transfer system has been underpinned by the Bayh-Dole Act, federal legislation which gives universities the rights to the IP that stems from federally funded R&D, and which the universities can then license out to entrepreneurs. In fact, nearly 73 percent of U.S. university licensing deals involves startups (quite commonly university spin-offs) or small companies. [24] Several European nations—including Belgium, Denmark, and Germany—have technology transfer legislation supporting university commercialization of publicly funded research, but there is no European-wide policy in this regard. [25] Europe would benefit from its own Bayh-Dole Act-like framework. But recognizing the subsidiarity challenge here, ITIF applauds the Commission’s plan to develop a blueprint for licensing, royalty, and revenue-sharing and equity participation for European higher education institutions and research-performing organizations when commercializing IP and creating spinoff companies. The European Commission can further work to establish and socialize best practices when it comes to the IP licensing practices of European universities. The European Commission should also work to advocate for other best practices pertaining to stimulating entrepreneurship activity out of European universities. A global movement called “Promotion & Tenure—Innovation & Entrepreneurship” (PTIE) has emerged to support the inclusive recognition of innovation and entrepreneurship (I&E) impact by university faculty in promotion, tenure, and advancement guidelines and practices. [26] The movement notes, “Academic promotion and tenure (P&T) processes that typically prioritize faculty grants and publications can fail to fully access and value entrepreneurial, innovative endeavours that can produce the kind of societal impacts that universities are increasingly being called upon to provide and that many faculty and students increasingly prioritize.” [27] Certainly, considering professors’ and researchers’ roles in developing patents or other IP or launching start-up companies should become a larger factor in making tenure decisions at European universities. Along these lines, European universities could become more entrepreneurial by enhancing the permeability between academia and industry, such as by extending entrepreneurial leave to faculty (and students) seeking to launch entrepreneurial ventures. Getting more commercialization leverage out of European universities is certainly attainable, as one study by the European Patent Office found that only about one-third of the patented inventions from European universities are commercially exploited. [28] Europe badly trails the United States (and increasingly China) in access to risk capital. In fact, from 2013 to 2022, venture capital (VC) raised by VC firms headquartered in the United States outstripped VC raised by European-headquartered VC firms by $1.2 trillion. [29] Annual VC investments in the European Union averaged just 0.2 percent as a share of EU GDP from 2013 to 2023, compared with a U.S. average of 0.7 percent. [30] This paucity of VC helps explain why by the time they reach 10 years in operation, European scale-ups have raised on average 50 percent less capital than their San Francisco peers. Further, more than 50 percent of late-stage investment in European tech companies comes from outside the EU, making European startups dependent on foreign capital. To deepen access to risk capital, Europe should reform its rules governing public pensions to permit pension funds to invest a fraction of their investments into VC companies, something which is permitted in the United States but not in Europe. Eight years after allowing U.S. pension funds to invest in risk capital, such as VC, the share of pension funds in VC increased from 15 to more than 50 percent. [31] More than 60 percent of European household investments remain within their home country, limiting cross-border capital flows across Europe; reforming pension investment controls could facilitate greater movement of capital across Europe. In the EU, most pension funds are managed at the national level, complicating broad reform across Europe. Rather than implementing sweeping changes across Europe, the European Commission should initiate an effort to document all national pension investment frameworks across Europe and provide recommendations on a national basis, encouraging the deregulation of investment capabilities. [32] Increasing access to risk capital requires greater investment in the European Investment Fund (EIF) and European Investment Bank (EIB). National governments and the EU should increase capital contributions to the two lending institutions, and the European Council should act to remove the lending limit placed on the EIB. The gearing ratio, which was amended earlier this year, has increased to 290 percent of the bank’s capital, allowing for greater risk-taking. [33] However, removing the cap altogether will enable the EIB to increase its lending ability in the future without the need for future adjustments to the gearing ratio, allowing the bank to undertake more investments. [34] The EU should also reduce restrictions on who may invest in large VC funds exceeding €500 million. Under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), investors must meet the full authorization requirements to become an AIFM, a process that is lengthy and costly. Additionally, the funds must meet capital adequacy and disclosure reporting requirements, must appoint a depository bank to oversee fund assets, and must undergo much more regulatory scrutiny than required for funds under €500 million. [35] These regulations increase the cost of running a VC fund, even though the risk is similar for a fund of €100 million and €500 million. Implementing the existing standards of the EU Venture Capital Funds Regulation (EuVECA) for larger VC funds would reduce the cost and barrier to entry for investors in these larger funds. In the recently approved European Union Council document on “The importance of research and innovation for the EU Startup and Scaleup Strategy,” the Council “Stresses the important contribution of private and public funding to reach the 3% GDP target for R&D.” [36] Indeed, Europe is underinvesting in R&D. Consider that of the top 100 (out of the top 2,500) R&D-investing firms in the world, America’s top 100 R&D investors invested €16.6 billion in R&D in 2024, while European firms invested just €3 billion. For the top 500 R&D-investing firms, American ones invested €21.8 billion, while European firms invested just €5.7 billion, a nearly four-fold gap. [37] This matters especially because Europe is caught in a “middle technology trap.” Examining the R&D investments of European firms among the top 2,500 European R&D investors by sector, automobiles and auto parts received the highest share, at 0.6 percent of total R&D investment of those firms. By comparison, in the United States, software & services received the highest share of total R&D investment by the top 2,500 R&D-investing firms, with a 0.14 percent share, followed by other high-tech (0.12 percent), and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology (0.10 percent). [38] (See figure 1.) In other words, U.S. firms are investing much more R&D into cutting-edge technology areas (e.g., AI, quantum, biotechnology, etc.) than are European ones. This in part explains why one study finds EU countries and the United Kingdom account for just 2 percent of the cumulative share of AI patents granted globally, while the United States accounts for 21 percent and China 61 percent. [39] In short, it is imperative that Europe’s public and private sectors invest more in R&D and that the continent invest more risk capital into cutting-edge industries. Figure 1: Business R&D investment by sector (top 2,500 R&D investing firms, by country, 2024) [40] The EIA is a necessary, but insufficient, initiative to address the EU’s competitiveness challenges. The European Commission should not let the EIA become another incremental initiative that tinkers at the edges of Europe’s competitiveness challenge. The EIA focuses on improvements that do not solve the continent’s structural weaknesses. Instead, the Commission should rethink Europe’s entire regulatory posture. If the EU continues to prioritize hypothetical risks over tangible benefits, European firms will remain slower, smaller, and less competitive than their American and Chinese counterparts. The Commission should use the EIA to place innovation at the bedrock of EU policymaking. Without these steps, the EU risks permanently falling behind its rivals. Thank you for your consideration.

Tip of the Iceberg: Understanding the Full Depth of Big Tech’s Contribution to US Innovation and Competitiveness Key Takeaways Introduction Societal Benefits Recognize and Account for the “Full Iceberg” Conclusion Endnotes,2025-10-06,Hilal Aka,"While critics attack “big tech” from many angles, these five companies develop frontier technologies that require large-scale development, build infrastructure ranging from data centers to subsea cables, and create spillovers from health care to nuclear energy. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Societal Benefits 4 Recognize and Account for the “Full Iceberg” 33 Conclusion . 34 Endnotes 34 As late as the early 2010s, large U.S. information technology companies were celebrated by politicians, media, and academics. Now they attack big tech as too powerful and greedy. Liberals complain that they are surveilling society, spreading harmful content, and undermining democracy. Conservatives say that they are censoring free speech, influencing elections, and undermining traditional American values. Both sides believe that they are harming children and both right and left populists want to break them up. [1] This “voguish” critique is based on at best a superficial understanding of what these companies do: Apple makes iPhones; Amazon makes an online store; Alphabet makes a search engine; Microsoft makes Word, Excel, and PowerPoint; and Meta makes social networks. Especially for those who dismiss social media as at best trivial entertainment, this view sees only the tip of the iceberg of the massive benefits large technology companies provide to the world and the United States. At the same time critics attack big tech, they also argue that U.S. corporations don’t invest enough in the long term—in research and development (R&D), in capital investment, in efforts that have high risks and long-term returns. If only these “quarterly capitalism” companies would act better, everyone would be better off. And yet, big tech is doing the opposite of quarterly capitalism, and those efforts should be praised rather than excoriated. While many major U.S. technology firms—including Cisco, Qualcomm, and Nvidia—demonstrate similar innovation patterns and positive spillovers, space constraints limit this report to examining five: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft. R&D: In 2024, the five largest U.S. technology companies invested $227 billion in R&D, exceeding the federal government’s non-defense R&D budget and outpacing the annual R&D expenditures of most countries. [2] These investments were not limited to core business lines. Research by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) finds that approximately 78 percent of non-manufacturing R&D growth came from just four industries: electronic shipping and electronic auctions; data processing, hosting, and related services (e.g., cloud providers); software publishers; and other information (e.g., Internet companies). [3] Big tech companies also fund long-horizon research into artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and semiconductors; they underwrite experimental “moonshot” projects that may fail commercially but advance technical capabilities; and they generate spillovers that diffuse across academia, startups, and industry more broadly. [4] Capital Investment: In 2024, these companies invested over $250 billion in capital expenditures, and cumulatively, they have invested over $1 trillion in the 21st century. [5] Training a competitive large language model can cost more than $100 million in compute resources. [6] Developing quantum processors requires billion-dollar fabrication facilities and programs extending over a decade or more. [7] Building global satellite constellations or hyperscale cloud infrastructure involves up-front investments in the tens of billions of dollars. [8] Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, and Apple finance data centers, subsea cables, renewable energy projects, and custom semiconductor platforms that underpin not only their own operations but also the broader digital economy. [9] Public Knowledge Generation: Big tech firms publish thousands of research papers annually, release open source frameworks, and make large datasets and models available to universities and startups. [10] Initiatives such as Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which mapped 200 million protein structures and released them freely, accelerate biomedical research worldwide. [11] This openness distinguishes U.S. firms from more traditional corporate R&D models, wherein proprietary knowledge rarely circulates outside company boundaries. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Skill Development: These companies serve as training grounds for highly skilled researchers and engineers who later move into startups, universities, and government laboratories. Alums have founded thousands of companies, raising tens of billions of dollars in venture funding and diffusing organizational knowledge about building scalable systems. [12] In sectors such as AI, where global competition for talent is intense, this clustering effect strengthens the U.S. ecosystem as a whole. [13] Funding for Startups: Acquisitions and partnerships link large firms to the startup ecosystem, providing capital, technical infrastructure, and global reach. While critics describe this as anticompetitive, empirical evidence shows that acquisition activity often validates markets and attracts further venture investment. [14] High-profile cases, such as that of YouTube and Android, demonstrate how integration with larger platforms can rescue promising technologies from collapse and scale them to have a global impact. [15] Blocking acquisitions, by contrast, has at times produced the opposite of the intended result, leading to firm failure and strategic losses to foreign competitors. [16] Innovations Beyond the Information Sector: Big Tech is primarily about information—generation, storage, analysis, and transmission. But it is about much more than that. These companies are innovating in a range of important areas, including national defense, transportation, agriculture, education, health care, space travel, and more. The United States finds itself in an existential techno-economic war with China, where the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is seeking to dominate all advanced industries, including manufacturing and information. [17] And it has core advantages, including a closed domestic market, massive government subsidies, and favorable antitrust rules that encourage size and scale. Given the severe U.S. government fiscal constraints, it is not realistic to expect the U.S. government to match the financial largess the CCP bestows on its big tech champions. If the United States does not want to lose to China, it needs to strengthen, not weaken, its large technology companies. Too many have defaulted to adopting the European model of hobbling, Gulliver-like, America’s large technology companies through taxes, regulations, fines, antitrust breakups, and other restrictions. [18] The idea that doing so will boost U.S. innovation and competitors is so farcical that it’s amazing that anyone can believe it. If we continue down that Brussels path, the result will be clear: an America where, in a decade or two’s time, today’s big tech firms are looked at nostalgically the way we look at past tech leaders such as Xerox, RCA, Lucent, and Kodak. That is why, at the very least, what the U.S. policy can do with regard to its own big tech companies is no harm. Doing so will certainly strengthen America’s global competitiveness and the jobs big tech creates at home. It will also support U.S national security. [19] American advances in AI, semiconductors, and quantum computing are overwhelmingly driven by private R&D. The Pentagon adapts these capabilities for defense applications, benefiting from billions in commercial investment that government contracts alone would not reproduce at a similar scale or speed. [20] And it will help enable innovation across a range of traditional sectors where traditional firms are underinvesting in high-risk activities. Overall, the prevailing discourse reduces these firms to consumer platforms and market power, overlooking the broader system of innovation, infrastructure, and security that depends on their scale. Policies that treat big tech primarily as a problem risk weakening assets that underpin U.S. competitiveness. A more complete assessment requires recognizing the positive externalities they generate. R&D determines which nations lead in technological advancement and economic competitiveness. [21] The source and scale of R&D funding shape what technologies get developed, how quickly they reach market, and which countries capture the resulting economic benefits. Today, private corporations have emerged as the dominant funders of R&D, with five U.S. technology companies alone investing more than the entire federal government and most other countries. This concentration of research capacity creates distinctive advantages, namely the ability to sustain decade-long losses on experimental technologies, pursue innovations requiring billions in up-front investment, maintain portfolio approaches to high-risk research, and compete with state-backed entities without direct government support. These investments are fundamentally profit driven. But while companies pursue R&D to maintain a competitive advantage and capture future markets, they also generate substantial positive externalities. The technologies, knowledge, and capabilities developed through corporate R&D frequently diffuse beyond the investing firms, creating benefits for competitors, academia, and society at large that exceed the private returns captured by the companies themselves. Transformative technologies typically require extended periods of investment, with highly uncertain returns. The transistor took 23 years from its invention at Bell Labs to reach widespread commercial adoption. [22] The Internet evolved over decades with government support before private commercialization. [23] These extended timelines, combined with high failure rates, don’t make it very desirable to fund research that may take decades to pay off, if ever. Traditional capital markets demand returns within 5–10 years. Government grants operate on even shorter cycles. This mismatch between innovation timelines and funding horizons constrains breakthrough research. Figure 1: Big tech companies’ R&D spending, 2015–2024 (billions) [24] The leading five U.S. technology companies—Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft—invested $227 billion in R&D in 2024. [25] This exceeds the $172 billion U.S. federal R&D budget and the total annual R&D expenditure of most countries in 2023. [26] The scale represents not just large numbers but also a qualitative difference in innovation capacity. When individual companies deploy tens of billions of dollars annually on research, they can sustain projects that would exhaust traditional funding sources. Figure 2: U.S. private sector R&D spending, 2015–2024 (billions) Google’s parent company, Alphabet, demonstrates this capacity through its experimental X division. In 2016, the division reported quarterly losses of $859 million pursuing “moonshot” projects, with estimated annual losses between $3 billion and $4 billion. [27] These projects included Internet-delivery balloons, glucose-monitoring contact lenses, and autonomous vehicles—technologies with uncertain commercial prospects but potentially transformative impacts. Despite the losses, Alphabet’s stock rose 6 percent after the earnings announcement, reflecting investor acceptance of long-term research investments supported by profitable core businesses. Figure 3: U.S. big tech companies’ R&D spending vs. select countries’ totals, 2015–2024 (billions) [28] Alphabet’s experimental X division reported quarterly losses of $859 million pursuing moonshot projects. Despite the losses, Alphabet’s stock rose 6 percent, reflecting investor acceptance of long-term research investments. Amazon’s approach to hardware development illustrates sustained commitment despite commercial failure. The company’s devices division, centered on Alexa-enabled products, lost over $25 billion between 2017 and 2021. [29] In just the first quarter of 2022, the division lost another $3 billion. [30] The company sold Echo devices at or below cost, hoping to generate revenue through voice commerce that never materialized. Yet, Amazon sustained these losses for nearly a decade, advancing voice recognition and natural language processing technologies in the process. Custom semiconductor development represents another domain where only the largest technology companies can compete. Apple’s transition to proprietary silicon required years of development and billions in investment, culminating in chips that now power its entire product line. This vertical integration, designing processors specifically optimized for their software and AI workloads, requires sustained investment that few companies can match. Figure 4: Subset of big tech companies’ losses on high-risk, high-reward moonshot projects [31] This financial capacity derives from profitable core businesses that generate massive cash flows. Amazon Web Services (AWS) produced $62 billion in revenue in 2021 with operating margins exceeding 30 percent. [32] Alphabet’s advertising business generates over $200 billion annually. [33] Big tech companies funnel significant shares of profits to research portfolios that no other entities can easily match in scale or duration. The private sector cross-subsidization model bypasses capital market constraints that would terminate unprofitable research in traditional settings. Frontier technologies exhibit escalating capital requirements that create natural barriers to participation. Breakthroughs in AI, quantum computing, and autonomous systems demand massive up-front investments. These requirements stem from fundamental technical constraints rather than artificial barriers. Training large language models exemplifies the scale. OpenAI’s GPT-3 required over $4.6 million in compute costs alone for a single training run. [34] GPT-4 pushed costs above $100 million. [35] Industry estimates suggest that next-generation models will require billions of dollars in infrastructure investment. The exponential relationship between model capability and computational requirements, wherein each order of magnitude improvement demands roughly two orders of magnitude more compute, creates mounting barriers to entry. [36] Figure 5: R&D and infrastructure costs for frontier technologies [37] Only organizations with exceptional resources can develop AI models that rely on dedicated access to hundreds of thousands of specialized processors. When OpenAI needed to scale GPT-4 training, it secured resources through an expanded partnership with Microsoft, which provided both funding and exclusive access to Azure infrastructure. [38] Smaller organizations, regardless of technical talent, cannot access comparable computational resources because the cost is simply too great. Autonomous vehicle development presents similar scale requirements. Alphabet’s Waymo has invested over $5 billion since its inception, funding not just research but also extensive infrastructure. [39] The program requires custom sensor development, high-definition mapping of entire metropolitan areas, sophisticated simulation environments processing millions of virtual miles, and real-world testing fleets. Each component demands specialized expertise and sustained funding that few organizations can provide. Quantum computing pushes scale requirements even further. Alphabet’s 2019 achievement of quantum supremacy marked the culmination of 13 years of sustained investment. [40] The program required custom fabrication facilities for quantum processors, cryogenic systems maintaining temperatures near absolute zero, and interdisciplinary teams spanning physics, computer science, and engineering. [41] Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft are pursuing similar programs, each investing billions without near-term revenue prospects. [42] These examples illustrate how technological complexity drives capital concentration. As innovations require integration across multiple disciplines, longer development cycles, and more sophisticated infrastructure, the minimum viable investment rises correspondingly. This creates a natural filter where only organizations with exceptional financial capacity can pursue frontier technologies. Innovation inherently involves exploring multiple technical paths with uncertain outcomes. Historical analysis of major technologies reveals consistent patterns: numerous failed approaches preceded each breakthrough, success often emerged from unexpected directions, and the ultimate applications differed from initial visions. [43] Effective innovation systems must therefore support portfolio approaches, pursuing multiple competing solutions simultaneously while maintaining tolerance for failure. Business scholar Clayton Christensen and others long criticized U.S. corporations for focusing on what he termed incremental, rather than breakthrough, innovation. [44] The former is making small, gradual improvements to existing products for current customers rather than pursuing transformative technologies. And he was right. Too many companies became too risk-averse, losing market share to foreign companies often backed by the deep pockets of the state. Large technology companies have focused significantly on breakthrough innovation and incorporated significant risk-taking practices, which are difficult for traditional organizations to match. Many of these projects fail and never make it to full commercialization, but at least these companies took the risk. Other projects do succeed. Microsoft has pursued topological quantum computing since 2005, investing billions of dollars in an unproven approach that could revolutionize the field or prove impossible. [45] Meta funds neural interface research through its Reality Labs, exploring electromyography (EMG) wristband technology for human-computer interaction despite long development horizons. [46] Microsoft has committed to purchasing electricity from Helion Power’s fusion reactors starting in 2028, although no company has yet successfully produced commercial fusion power. [47] This tolerance for extreme technical risk enables the pursuit of transformative technologies wherein theoretical feasibility remains unproven. [48] The portfolio strategy extends beyond simple failure tolerance. These companies pursue multiple competing technical approaches simultaneously, hedging against technical uncertainty. In AI, major firms maintain investments across different model architectures, training approaches, and application domains rather than commit to single paths. Microsoft invests in both its own AI research and the OpenAI partnership. Alphabet both develops Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and maintains GPU infrastructure. [49] This parallel exploration increases the probability that at least one approach succeeds. Nvidia exemplifies this strategy through its multi-track chip development, which runs three design teams simultaneously on staggered 18- to 24-month cycles, allowing for continuous innovation while hedging against the failure of any single architecture. [50] The company invested nearly $10 billion developing its B200 Blackwell chip alone, while maintaining parallel investments in its software ecosystem: over 900 CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) libraries that ensure its hardware advantages translate into practical applications. [51] Financial resilience enables countercyclical R&D investment, increasing research spending during economic downturns when competitors retreat. Academic research demonstrates that companies that maintain R&D investment through recessions emerge with significant advantages during recovery. [52] While smaller firms must cut research spending in order to survive downturns, and larger, more traditional firms cut to keep their share price up, large technology companies can accelerate investment when resources (talent, equipment, facilities) become more available and affordable. The risk capacity manifests in the willingness to pursue technologies with extreme uncertainty. Google Brain began as a speculative project with unclear commercial applications. [53] The team explored whether deep learning techniques, largely abandoned by the AI community, could achieve breakthrough results with sufficient scale. The project consumed massive computational resources with no guarantee of success. Today, the technologies developed generate over $10 billion annually through search improvements and cloud services. China’s innovation model poses a systematic challenge to market-based systems through the coordinated use of state resources. The Chinese government allocated over $450 billion to R&D in 2023, representing an 8.1 percent increase aimed at sustaining growth above 7 percent annually. [54] This spending operates within an integrated system in which state-owned enterprises, research institutes, and nominally private companies align with national objectives. Recent initiatives include a $138 billion fund for quantum computing, AI, and semiconductors. [55] These state subsidies constitute more than aggressive competition; they violate fundamental principles of international trade. As ITIF has documented extensively, China’s systematic use of below-market financing, production subsidies, and state-directed overcapacity represents predatory innovation mercantilism designed to capture entire industries rather than compete on merit. [56] These strategies violate World Trade Organization (WTO) subsidy rules, antidumping principles, and the basic reciprocity underlying global trade. [57] Against China’s coordinated state-capital model, traditional market competition proves insufficient. Startups and mid-sized companies lack the resources to compete with entities backed by sovereign wealth and fight decade-long price wars. The state-directed approach demonstrates effectiveness through market dominance in targeted sectors. Chinese solar manufacturers control over 80 percent of global production after sustained below-cost pricing drove out international competitors. [58] Government subsidies enabled this strategy, accepting losses that would bankrupt private firms. In telecommunications, state backing allowed Huawei to underbid Western competitors by 30–40 percent while investing more in R&D than did Nokia and Ericsson combined. [59] The pattern repeats across strategic industries from batteries to drones. [60] Against this coordinated model, traditional market competition proves insufficient. Startups and mid-sized companies lack the resources to compete with entities backed by sovereign wealth and fight decade-long price wars. [61] Government research grants, while valuable, operate at scales that are inadequate and inconsistent for competing with national industrial strategies. [62] The structural mismatch between dispersed market actors and coordinated state capital threatens technological leadership. American technology companies provide the essential counterweight through concentrated private resources. The $227 billion in R&D spending by five firms approaches Chinese state investment while maintaining market discipline. [63] These companies possess the scale to sustain long-term competition, absorb temporary losses, and invest in next-generation technologies without government direction. The competition extends beyond financial resources to innovation models. While China excels at scaling proven technologies through state support, U.S. corporate laboratories maintain advantages in breakthrough innovation. Private companies alone cannot counter China’s state-coordinated approach; the United States requires more comprehensive policy responses, from strategic industrial support to coordinated trade enforcement. Yet, large technology companies provide critical leverage in this competition. Another complaint levied against U.S. corporations is that too much of their research focuses on the development side of the continuum rather than on earlier-stage research. In fact, leading American tech companies spend considerable amounts on basic research and openly publish their research findings. They also release tools freely available to developers and provide computing infrastructure to universities and independent researchers. This openness creates knowledge spillovers and enables research capabilities across the broader innovation ecosystem. Open research speeds up innovation. When companies publish their findings, other researchers can build on that work immediately instead of starting from scratch. This creates faster progress across the entire field. The benefits extend throughout the economy—startups can use published AI models without developing their own, universities can access datasets they couldn’t afford to create, and engineers can adopt proven methods rather than reinvent solutions. Economic analyses show that open data generates 0.5 percent more gross domestic product (GDP) annually compared with data requiring payment, with global economic impact estimates ranging from $3 trillion to $5 trillion per year. [64] Figure 6: Big tech vs other companies’ contributions to AI advancement [65] Figure 7: U.S. companies’ AI models by training compute (FLOPS, log scale) [66] Figure 8: Top 10 critical tech patent contributors (excluding life sciences) [67] Figure 9: Top 10 patent contributors to U.S. defense tech [68] NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR are the top three influential AI conferences based on Google Scholar metrics, with acceptance rates usually between 20 and 25 percent. [69] At these top-tier conferences, Alphabet released over 500 research papers in 2023, with DeepMind researchers presenting more than 80 papers at ICML 2023 and Microsoft submitting over 100 accepted papers at NeurIPS 2024. [70] Industry research produced 51 notable machine learning models in 2023, compared with 15 from academia . [71] This volume establishes tech companies as the largest contributors to top-tier AI conferences alongside leading universities. At top-tier AI conferences, industry research produced 51 notable machine learning models in 2023, compared with 15 from academia. The real economic impact comes through open source infrastructure. TensorFlow and PyTorch, developed by Alphabet and Meta, respectively, are software frameworks that enable developers to build and deploy AI applications . [72] These frameworks provide the essential building blocks, from basic mathematical operations to complex neural network architectures, that developers need to create AI systems. Without them, each organization would need to write thousands of lines of foundational code before even beginning its actual AI work. TensorFlow commands 37 percent market share and PyTorch 25 percent among machine learning tools. [73] PyTorch’s adoption by 80 percent of research papers at major conferences demonstrates how quickly open tools can become industry standards. [74] Developing a production-grade machine learning framework requires substantial investment in terms of engineering teams, infrastructure, and years of refinement. By providing these tools freely, big tech companies eliminate redundant development efforts across thousands of organizations. Figure 10: Big tech contributions to critical open source infrastructure (indexed scores by CSET) [75] AlphaFold is a prime example of the benefits of open research. Google DeepMind’s protein structure prediction system, cited over 20,000 times since release, accelerates research across pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and materials science. [76] The Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative uses it to develop treatments for diseases that affect billions but generate little profit. [77] Academic labs apply it to antibiotic resistance and cancer research. [78] Industrial researchers use it to design new enzymes and materials. [79] This single open release may accelerate hundreds of drug development programs by years. Big tech companies naturally maintain significant proprietary research operations because their core products and competitive advantages depend on it. Yet, compared with traditional corporate R&D models, wherein virtually all research remains internal, big tech has normalized publishing academic research and releasing foundational tools while competing fiercely in product markets. This balance distinguishes their contribution to the innovation landscape. Advances in AI, semiconductors, and complex software require large teams of specialized researchers and engineers. Companies and countries compete intensely for this talent. Success depends not just on recruiting individuals but also on building talent clusters in which people can move between organizations, share knowledge, and start new ventures. These clusters extend far beyond Silicon Valley. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon has attracted research labs and offices from prominent companies such as Apple, Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft, Disney, Facebook, IBM, and others to its campus, creating a hub that city officials describe as “the nation’s most concentrated AI hub outside of Silicon Valley.” [80] In Chicago, the University of Illinois Systems Discovery Partners Institute runs programs that include partnerships with AWS, Alphabet, Microsoft, and dozens of other tech companies, training nearly 30 students from universities including University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Illinois Chicago, and City Colleges of Chicago. [81] These geographic expansions demonstrate how big tech companies anchor innovation ecosystems nationwide, training talent who later work across the economy. Amazon’s robotics investments further demonstrate this ecosystem-building effect. The company employs over 750,000 robots across its operations and has hired thousands of robotics engineers, creating a critical mass of automation talent. [82] These engineers develop expertise that later diffuses throughout the economy as they move to startups and other industries, helping establish U.S. leadership in industrial automation. [83] Big tech’s role in talent development extends well beyond its direct employees. Companies invest heavily in K-12 and university STEM education programs that build the broader talent pipeline. Microsoft’s TEALS (Technology Education and Literacy in Schools) program exemplifies this commitment. [84] It pairs over 1,650 volunteers from more than 700 companies with high school teachers to co-teach computer science, operating in 31 states and serving 17,000 students annually. [85] Microsoft Research’s fellowship program has supported over 700 Ph.D. students globally. [86] Thousands more cycle through internships, postdoctoral positions, and visiting researcher programs annually. These positions provide not just funding but also access to mentorship, datasets, and infrastructure unavailable in academia. The Nvidia-University of Florida (UF) partnership demonstrates how industry investments create ecosystem-wide benefits. Through $25 million in hardware, software, and training support, Nvidia enabled UF to share AI resources with all 12 Florida state universities. [87] The partnership trained over 800 students through certified instructors and extended advanced computing access to institutions traditionally excluded from such resources. [88] The entrepreneurial impact is also substantial. Former Alphabet employees founded 14 of the top 50 AI startups that have collectively raised $14.7 billion at a combined valuation of $71.61 billion as of October 2024. [89] The broader ecosystem extends far beyond AI—2,300 companies founded by Google alumni have raised $98.2 billion across all sectors, while Microsoft alumni have created 5,923 companies, raising $69 billion in total. [90] Meta demonstrates the highest funding success rate at 62.9 percent despite fewer total startups, with alumni founding critical AI companies including OpenAI and Harvey. [91] Big tech companies actively support this talent circulation through structured programs that maintain connections with the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Google’s AI Futures Fund provides equity investment and early access to DeepMind models, Microsoft for Startups offers up to $100,000 in Azure credits with technical mentorship through its GrowthX Accelerator, and Meta’s Llama Startup Program provides $6,000 monthly in cloud inference costs. [92] Leading American tech companies build hyperscale data centers, submarine cables, and renewable energy infrastructure. This infrastructure strengthens U.S. economic competitiveness, enhances national security capabilities, and creates positive spillovers for other industries. Digital infrastructure has become as essential to the modern economy as roads and electricity, yet the scale of investment required exceeds what governments can provide alone. While the benefits of digital infrastructure are clear, the U.S. government lacks the necessary funds to lead. [93] The federal government invests $208 billion annually in R&D, but this funding primarily supports basic research rather than the massive capital deployments needed for data centers, subsea cables, and computational infrastructure. [94] A report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies emphasizes that “companies’ participation and collaboration with governments are essential,” particularly where “governments alone often cannot provide sufficient technological advancement.” [95] Digital infrastructure has become as essential to the modern economy as roads and electricity, yet the scale of investment required exceeds what governments can provide alone. The U.S. technology sector now invests over $300 billion annually in AI infrastructure alone, filling gaps that traditional government programs cannot address due to budget constraints, procurement delays, and the rapid pace of technological change. [96] Amazon committed $150 billion to data center expansion over 15 years, exceeding the federal government’s entire annual R&D budget. [97] Alphabet owns or leases stakes in at least 16 subsea cables, creating redundant data pathways that enhance both commercial efficiency and national security. [98] These investments represent strategic bets on unproven technologies rather than conventional capital expenditures. Modern digital infrastructure requires technical capabilities beyond traditional engineering. Hyperscale data centers need breakthrough innovations in cooling, power management, and network architecture. When commercial semiconductors proved inadequate for AI workloads, companies developed custom silicon—Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units, Amazon’s Graviton processors, and Microsoft’s Azure Maia chips—investing billions without guaranteed returns. Meta built AI training clusters with 24,576 H100 GPUs, computational resources that exceed most government capabilities. [99] Technology companies pursue infrastructure investments in emerging technologies with no clear path to profitability. Alphabet achieved quantum supremacy in 2019, following a decade of investment that yielded no immediate commercial applications. AWS provides access to quantum computing through Braket, subsidizing million-dollar systems for researchers. Microsoft experiments with underwater data centers and novel cooling technologies that may take decades to yield a return. These long-term bets on frontier technologies would fail traditional investment criteria, but prove essential for maintaining technological leadership. Digital infrastructure control translates directly into geopolitical influence. When nations and businesses integrate their operations with global technology platforms, they align with the infrastructure owners’ technical standards, governance models, and operational practices. These relationships deepen over time as economies build innovative capabilities on these platforms, creating technical interconnections and shared interests that strengthen international partnerships. Infrastructure ownership thus generates influence through technological integration. American cloud providers dominate with 62–67 percent of global cloud infrastructure, enabling them to establish technical standards through market adoption rather than regulatory mandates. [100] When AWS implements security requirements for 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies, these protocols become global best practices, as companies align their operations with the platform’s capabilities. [101] Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative leverages American cloud platforms, with government agencies using AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud to deliver advanced urban services and digital governance. [102] Estonia has built its pioneering e-government system through these platforms, enabling everything from digital identity verification to seamless tax collection. [103] American cloud providers dominate with 62–67 percent of global cloud infrastructure, enabling them to establish technical standards through market adoption rather than regulatory mandates. Platform capabilities enable coordinated responses during geopolitical crises through commercial mechanisms. Following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Microsoft, Google Cloud, and AWS restricted services to sanctioned entities while ensuring continued support for Ukrainian agencies and their allies. [104] These actions required no government infrastructure or military resources. Private companies enforced terms of service that align with international sanctions, demonstrating how commercial decisions support diplomatic objectives. The business logic driving platform expansion creates these strategic advantages through commercial competition. Cloud providers are pursuing international markets to capture projected spending of $679 billion in 2024, necessitating a global presence to achieve economies of scale. [105] Amazon plans $100 billion in capital expenditure for 2025, primarily for AWS infrastructure that will serve both commercial and government customers worldwide. [106] Competition for enterprise clients drives continuous security improvements that benefit all users, while platform companies maintain high standards to protect brand reputation. These commercial imperatives consistently produce outcomes that align with democratic governance principles and strengthen America’s partnerships with allies. Figure 11: GPU cluster market share [107] China’s aggressive expansion of its digital infrastructure threatens American technological leadership and access to emerging markets. Beijing has weaponized infrastructure investment to create exclusive economic zones where American companies cannot compete—when Huawei builds a nation’s 4G network, U.S. firms lose that market for mobile services, cloud computing, and digital payments. This infrastructure competition determines whether American companies can access the 3 billion users coming online in developing markets and whether U.S. technical standards will govern the global digital economy. Losing this competition means ceding control of the world’s fastest-growing economies to China. China has invested heavily through its Digital Silk Road initiative, with $79 billion deployed by 2018 and continued significant investments since. [108] Huawei controls 70 percent of Africa’s 4G networks, creating Chinese-dominated markets across the continent. [109] These deployments require exclusive Chinese suppliers and mandate routing data to be processed through Beijing’s systems. Zimbabwe agreed to share facial data with CloudWalk to help train its AI systems. [110] Each Chinese infrastructure win locks out American companies for decades—once a country builds on Huawei equipment, switching costs make changing to U.S. systems economically impossible. American companies counter through commercial innovation that keeps markets open. Alphabet’s $1 billion Equiano cable provides 20 times more West African capacity, creating $7 billion in GDP growth that American businesses can capture. [111] AWS and Microsoft cloud services let countries build digital economies that remain accessible to U.S. firms. [112] Meta’s Llama and Google’s TensorFlow establish American AI standards globally through voluntary adoption by millions of developers. [113] Meta’s expansion of Llama access to NATO, EU institutions, and key allied nations for defense applications creates a shared AI infrastructure that excludes China while strengthening democratic technological cooperation. [114] These investments ensure that American companies can compete in emerging markets rather than being locked out by Chinese infrastructure monopolies. Business incentives drive American success more effectively than government programs do. Companies invest to capture growth in markets such as Africa, which is projected to reach $712 billion by 2050. [115] Commercial competition pushes firms to offer superior technology and transparent terms. Open sourcing creates global developer communities trained on American platforms. While companies pursue profits, their infrastructure investments secure U.S. economic interests by keeping emerging markets open to American business and preventing Chinese monopolization of the digital future. U.S. technology companies invest over $200 billion annually in R&D for AI, quantum computing, and advanced semiconductors—technologies that define modern military advantage. [116] This commercial investment creates a dual-use dividend: the Pentagon gains access to capabilities developed through market competition rather than government contracts alone, while companies expand their innovations into defense applications. The result strengthens both U.S. economic competitiveness and national security without requiring separate development tracks. AI enables military systems to process vast amounts of data and identify threats more quickly than humans ever could. AI algorithms can scan satellite imagery covering thousands of square miles to detect military vehicles, analyze patterns across millions of intercepted communications to predict attacks, and identify potential equipment failures before they occur. [117] In practice, this means U.S. forces can detect Chinese naval movements across the Pacific, track terrorist networks through digital signatures, and maintain aircraft with unprecedented efficiency. The same AI capabilities drive drug discovery for biodefense and optimize military supply chains. Quantum computing poses a threat to break the encryption protecting military communications, financial systems, and critical infrastructure. Current encryption relies on mathematical problems that would take classical computers billions of years to solve. Quantum computers could crack these codes in hours by evaluating multiple solutions simultaneously. [118] China has invested $15 billion in quantum research and claims quantum advances that could challenge U.S. technological superiority. [119] The United States allocated $1.2 billion through the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018, but commercial development by IBM, Alphabet, and others provides the bulk of American quantum capabilities. [120] Beyond code breaking, quantum computers will design new materials for hypersonic vehicles, optimize logistics across global supply chains, and enable quantum encryption that cannot be broken even by other quantum computers. While the United States lost semiconductor manufacturing leadership to Asia decades ago, American technology companies maintain dominance in chip design—the high-value intellectual property that drives innovation. [121] Companies such as Nvidia, Apple, and AMD invest billions in developing architectures that advance computing capabilities, creating innovations the military adapts for defense applications. [122] American technology companies drive advancement in all three domains through commercial R&D. [123] The military adapts these commercially developed technologies rather than funding them from scratch. [124] This arrangement benefits both sides: companies gain defense contracts and technical challenges that push innovation boundaries, while the military accesses capabilities that defense budgets alone could never create. [125] Unlike China’s military-civil fusion strategy that mandates technology transfer from companies to military institutions, the United States relies on voluntary commercial innovation in which technology companies’ market-driven R&D creates capabilities the military can adapt.

Modern military systems increasingly incorporate technologies originally developed for civilian markets, adapted through specialized integration and hardening processes. This approach leverages billions of dollars in commercial R&D while adding military-specific capabilities that traditional defense contractors typically develop. Cloud computing infrastructure exemplifies the successful transfer of commercial technology to the military. The Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract, valued at up to $9 billion through 2028, relies exclusively on commercial providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. [128] Each vendor brings distinct capabilities shaped by their commercial focus—AWS’s experience hosting the CIA’s classified systems since 2013, Azure’s enterprise integration tools refined through serving Fortune 500 companies, Alphabet’s AI and machine learning services developed for consumer applications, and Oracle’s database technologies proven in commercial financial systems. [129] The multivendor approach provides resilience and prevents single-point failures while maintaining competition for task orders. Microsoft’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System demonstrates both the potential and challenges of militarizing consumer technology. Based on the HoloLens 2 augmented reality headset, IVAS aims to provide soldiers with enhanced situational awareness through thermal imaging, navigation aids, and tactical overlays. [130] The program’s evolution reflects the iterative nature of commercial-to-military adaptation. Initial versions faced significant challenges—soldiers reported discomfort, reliability issues, and concerns about combat effectiveness. However, the commercial foundation enabled rapid iteration, with version 1.2 incorporating soldier feedback to improve ergonomics and performance. [131] Despite ongoing challenges that led to a program restructuring in 2025, the ability to leverage billions in commercial AR investment provided capabilities that purpose-built military development could not have achieved within similar timeframes. Modern military platforms contain thousands of processors manufactured in commercial facilities. For example, the F-35 fighter jet’s systems depend entirely on chips produced alongside commercial electronics. AI represents perhaps the most significant domain of commercial-to-military technology transfer. Project Maven, which applies AI to analyze drone footage and identify targets, has evolved from initial controversy over Alphabet’s participation to a multi-vendor effort involving Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Palantir, and numerous specialized firms. [132] These companies adapt computer vision algorithms originally developed for autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and consumer photography to military intelligence applications. The commercial AI ecosystem provides not just algorithms but entire development frameworks, training methodologies, and computational infrastructure that accelerate military AI deployment. The dependence on commercial semiconductor supply chains underscores how thoroughly military capabilities rely on commercial technology. Modern military platforms contain thousands of processors manufactured in commercial facilities. For example, the F-35 fighter jet’s systems depend entirely on chips produced alongside commercial electronics. [133] When military systems require specialized components such as radiation-hardened processors for space applications, commercial foundries modify their standard processes rather than establish dedicated military production lines. This approach provides access to cutting-edge manufacturing capabilities while maintaining economic viability. Avoiding the advice of former GE CEO Jack Welch, large technology companies are willing to engage in businesses in which they are not the dominant one or two players. In fact, they actively pursue research in health care, materials science, transportation, space, agriculture, and climate—fields far from their core businesses. These initiatives leverage computational infrastructure, AI expertise, and data processing capabilities to tackle problems for which these resources can accelerate progress. The pattern reveals companies directing significant R&D investments toward challenges beyond their commercial domains, creating spillover effects that benefit entire industries through both discoveries and open knowledge sharing. Biological systems involve interactions among thousands of molecules, each with complex three-dimensional structures. Traditional structure determination methods such as X-ray crystallography require extensive time and resources—the Protein Structure Initiative spent $1.4 billion over a decade to determine just 13,000 structures. [134] Drug development faces similar constraints, with the average new drug taking 10–15 years and $2.6 billion to bring to market, largely because preclinical screening cannot accurately predict human outcomes. [135] The computational approach changes these economics. AlphaFold predicted structures for 200 million proteins in 18 months—work that would have required centuries of traditional crystallography based on historical productivity rates. [136] By making the database freely available, Google DeepMind has enabled researchers worldwide to skip structure determination entirely. Over 500,000 researchers now use the resource, with studies citing AlphaFold appearing in journals at a rate of 17 per day by 2024. [137] Microsoft’s AI evaluated 32.6 million potential battery materials in 80 hours—screening that would traditionally take decades. Microsoft’s approach to drug discovery addresses the screening bottleneck. Working with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Microsoft’s AI evaluated 32.6 million potential battery materials in 80 hours—screening that would traditionally take decades. [138] Applied to tuberculosis research, its AI system achieved a 125-fold improvement in identifying effective inhibitors compared with random screening. [139] This demonstrates how computational methods can transform trial-and-error processes into targeted searches. Apple’s contribution comes through scale and accessibility. The Apple Heart Study enrolled 400,000 participants in eight months, detecting atrial fibrillation with an 84 percent positive predictive value. [140] Published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the study demonstrates how consumer devices enable population-scale medical research. [141] Traditional cardiac arrhythmia clinical trials typically enroll hundreds to thousands of participants over multiple years, making Apple’s approach a significant methodological advance. [142] Materials discovery has historically proceeded through iterative experimentation. Synthesizing and characterizing a new compound typically takes months, with computational studies suggesting that researchers test thousands of candidates to find one viable material. [143] The vast space of possible element combinations means most efforts eliminate nonviable options rather than develop useful materials. Computational modeling bypasses physical synthesis entirely. Google DeepMind’s GNoME discovered 2.2 million crystal structures by simulating atomic interactions, identifying stable configurations without creating them physically. [144] The 380,000 stable materials include 528 lithium-ion conductors—critical for battery technology. [145] External validation came when laboratories synthesized 736 materials, confirming computational predictions. [146] By adding discoveries to the open Materials Project database, the work expanded the searchable space of materials tenfold. Microsoft’s MatterGen takes a different approach, generating materials with specified properties rather than searching existing possibilities. [147] Creating structures harder than diamond (bulk modulus exceeding 400 gigapascals) demonstrates that computational design can exceed natural materials. [148] Open-sourcing these models democratizes materials discovery—institutions without supercomputers can now participate in materials innovation. Agricultural productivity faces information asymmetry: expertise concentrates in research institutions while farming happens in rural areas with limited access to specialists. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), plant diseases cause global crop losses of 20–40 percent annually, costing the global economy over $220 billion. [149] McKinsey research indicates that precision agriculture technologies can improve yields by 1520 percent through optimized resource use, but deploying sensors and analytics across millions of small farms presents economic challenges. [150] Smartphones change this equation. Google’s AI detects cassava diseases with 98 percent accuracy using phone cameras—but the innovation isn’t the accuracy; it’s making the model run offline on basic phones. [151] TensorFlow Lite versions work without Internet connectivity, crucial for rural deployment. [152] Agricultural ministries in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda have prevented $60 million in crop losses using these free tools. [153] Microsoft’s FarmBeats demonstrates how publishing complete technical specifications multiplies impact. The system reduces water usage by 30 percent while maintaining yields, but Microsoft hasn’t commercialize it. [154] Instead, publishing sensor designs and data pipelines have enabled agricultural universities to build systems locally. Technology transfer programs have reached 10,000 farms in India and Africa—scale achieved through replication rather than direct deployment. [155] Climate science requires computational infrastructure beyond most institutions’ reach. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operates high-performance computing facilities with procurement costs exceeding €50 million (~$58.7 million) and substantial annual operating expenses. [156] Processing satellite data for deforestation tracking requires petabyte-scale storage and computing power. This concentration of resources in wealthy nations creates gaps in climate monitoring for regions most vulnerable to climate change. Google DeepMind’s GraphCast breaks this constraint. The model produces 10-day forecasts that are more accurate than ECMWF but runs on a single machine in under one minute. [157] By open sourcing GraphCast, Alphabet enables any institution with a workstation to generate world-class weather predictions. [158] For developing nations, this transforms disaster preparedness—accurate cyclone predictions become possible without massive infrastructure investment. Data center energy optimization demonstrates how sharing methodologies creates compound benefits. Alphabet’s AI has reduced cooling requirements by 40 percent, achieving 1.1 Power Usage Effectiveness. [159] Publishing detailed methodologies has enabled competitors to achieve 20–30 percent reductions. [160] With data centers responsible for approximately 1 percent of global electricity consumption according to the International Energy Agency, industry-wide efficiency improvements have a significant climate impact. [161] Technology companies have emerged as critical catalysts for nuclear energy development, with Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon signing major agreements to develop new reactors and restart decommissioned ones. [162] Alphabet signed an agreement with Kairos Power to deliver six or seven small modular reactors (SMRs) between 2030 and 2035, Amazon anchored a $500 million investment round in X-energy, and Microsoft’s 20-year power purchase agreement enabled the restart of a reactor at Three Mile Island. [163] These investments provide crucial early market demand for SMRs, which, according to ITIF research, are “the only realistic path to significantly scale nuclear power in the United States” and could become “an important strategic export industry” over the next two decades. [164] Technology companies’ willingness to sign long-term power purchase agreements at premium prices provides the financial certainty needed for SMR manufacturers to achieve production scale. The spillover effects extend well beyond powering data centers. SMRs can provide thermal energy for industrial processes at temperatures suitable for chemicals production, petroleum refining, and desalination, creating decarbonization opportunities across multiple industries. [165] Technology companies’ willingness to sign long-term power purchase agreements at premium prices provides the financial certainty needed for SMR manufacturers to achieve production scale, while their expertise in simulation and modeling accelerates regulatory approvals. This private sector leadership is particularly important, as China currently has 58 reactors built and 29 under construction, with Russia’s Rosatom expanding into 13 countries, making technology companies’ investments essential for maintaining U.S. competitiveness in advanced nuclear technology. [166] Autonomous vehicles face a testing paradox: proving safety requires billions of miles of real-world driving, but deploying vehicles without proof creates liability. No single company can generate sufficient data. Traditional automotive testing—controlled tracks and simulations—doesn’t capture edge cases that cause accidents. Waymo’s decision to share safety methodologies after 71 million autonomous miles has created industry-wide benefits. [167] Demonstrating 85 percent fewer injury-causing crashes than human drivers matters less than publishing complete data and methodologies. [168] Competitors, including Cruise and Aurora, have adopted these standards, accelerating their development by years. The spillover effect has accelerated industry-wide progress toward reducing traffic fatalities, which claimed 38,824 lives in the United States in 2020, according to NHTSA. [169] Last-mile delivery represents 28 percent of total transportation costs, according to supply chain analyses, but has resisted optimization due to computational complexity. [170] Amazon’s routing algorithms solve problems with millions of variables—which packages go on which trucks in what order to minimize time and fuel. [171] Publishing these algorithms has enabled UPS, FedEx, and regional carriers to achieve 15–20 percent time reduction and 12 percent fuel savings. [172] The aggregate impact across the logistics industry exceeds Amazon’s own efficiency gains. Quantum computing is still in its early stages because building stable quantum systems with low error rates requires solving novel physics problems. The challenge isn’t just engineering but also discovering new states of matter and developing advanced error correction for quantum decoherence. Alphabet’s creation of time crystals—matter in perpetual motion without energy input—represents new physics with implications for quantum memory. [173] Publishing complete protocols in nature has enabled replication at Stanford and Oxford, advancing the field collectively. [174] Microsoft’s multidecade investment in topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes, shared through academic publications rather than patents, provides alternative approaches to quantum stability. [175] These parallel paths increase the probability of achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing, with applications from drug discovery to cryptography. There is a pattern across these contributions: technology companies address computational and data processing bottlenecks that limit progress in other fields. By sharing discoveries and methodologies rather than monopolizing them, they create spillover effects such that the collective benefit exceeds private returns—strengthening the broader innovation ecosystem beyond direct business interests. The U.S. technology ecosystem thrives on complementary capabilities between startups and established firms. While big tech companies conduct substantial internal R&D, certain types of innovation emerge more naturally from startups unburdened by existing business models and organizational structures. Conversely, breakthrough technologies often require capital intensity and infrastructure scale that only large platforms can provide. The median startup now requires approximately 11 years to reach IPO (Initial Public Offering), up from 5 years in 2000, during which time most need multiple funding rounds and operational support. [176] This extended timeline creates opportunities for productive collaboration, wherein startups bring agility and fresh perspectives while large firms provide patient capital, global distribution, and technical infrastructure. The result is an ecosystem wherein strategic acquisitions have become the dominant exit path, with only 11 percent of unicorn exits occurring through IPOs in 2024, down from 83 percent in 2010. [177] Figure 12 : Unicorn exit composition: IPOs vs. acquisitions, 2010–2024 [178] The traditional IPO pathway has constricted dramatically. Annual technology IPOs in the United States declined from a 1980–2019 median of 158 to just 72 in 2024, despite venture investment reaching $209 billion that year. [179] The median time from first venture funding to IPO exit has extended from 3.8 years in 2000 to over 8 years today. [180] This creates a liquidity challenge: with 741 U.S. unicorns currently awaiting exits and only 15 achieving them in the past 12 months, the theoretical backlog would take 49 years to clear at current rates. ⁵ When capital remains trapped in illiquid positions, venture funds cannot return money to limited partners, constraining future investment capacity. Large technology companies have evolved into essential liquidity providers for the venture ecosystem. Alphabet’s portfolio through GV includes over 700 investments, while Microsoft’s M12 has backed more than 100 companies since 2016. [181] These corporate venture arms don’t just provide capital—they establish valuation benchmarks that enable subsequent funding rounds. Facebook’s $1 billion Instagram acquisition in 2012, though controversial at the time, validated social media platform valuations. [182] Beyond direct investment, infrastructure support programs such as AWS Activate have provided over $7 billion in credits to startups since 2013, with more than 330,000 startups participating globally. [183] This enables companies to delay fundraising while proving product-market fit, with some qualifying for up to $100,000 in credits to offset cloud infrastructure costs . [184] Critics argue that big tech creates “kill zones” wherein venture capitalists avoid funding potential competitors. [185] However, empirical evidence challenges this narrative. Research shows that sectors experiencing recent big tech acquisitions actually attract increased venture investment, as successful exits demonstrate achievable returns and validate market opportunities. [186] The Instagram acquisition illustrates this dynamic: rather than deterring investment, it has catalyzed increased funding for social platforms by proving that billion-dollar valuations were achievable. Similarly, Google’s YouTube acquisition didn’t eliminate video platform competition but instead validated the market, leading to the emergence of TikTok, Twitch, and other successful platforms. The concern about predatory acquisitions remains valid for specific cases, but aggregate data suggests that acquisition activity generally correlates with increased rather than decreased startup formation. Strategic acquisitions often provide struggling startups with the resources needed to achieve their potential. YouTube faced existential challenges when Google acquired it for $1.65 billion in 2006—the company was burning through $1 million monthly in bandwidth costs while facing copyright lawsuits that threatened its survival. [187] Google’s infrastructure and legal resources enabled YouTube to reduce costs dramatically while resolving content disputes, growing into a platform that generated $50 billion in combined advertising and subscription revenue over the four quarters ending Q3 2024. [188] Android presents an even more dramatic transformation. Google acquired the struggling startup for just $50 million in 2005 when Android was nearly out of funding. [189] That investment enabled Android to become the operating system powering 71 percent of global smartphones, creating an app economy worth hundreds of billions annually. [190] Recent blocked acquisitions demonstrate how regulatory intervention can produce outcomes opposite to intended goals. When European regulators blocked Amazon’s $1.7 billion iRobot acquisition in January 2024 to preserve competition in robotic vacuums, iRobot collapsed within months—eliminating 572 jobs (51 percent of workforce), posting $145.5 million in losses, and forcing the company to explore strategic alternatives, including potential bankruptcy. [191] The company that pioneered consumer robotics and held 64 percent market share in 2016 now trades below $20 per share, while Chinese competitors Ecovacs and Roborock have captured the premium segments iRobot created. [192] When European regulators blocked Amazon’s iRobot acquisition to preserve competition, iRobot collapsed within months—eliminating 572 jobs and exploring bankruptcy. ARM Holdings immediately laid off 1,000 employees (15 percent of the workforce) when regulators blocked Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition in 2022, abandoning growth investments the merger would have enabled during the AI boom. [193] China’s strategic use of merger review demonstrates the geopolitical dimension: blocking Qualcomm’s $44 billion NXP acquisition after eight other jurisdictions approved it, preventing American semiconductor consolidation while Chinese competitors strengthened their position in automotive chips. [194] Not every acquisition succeeds—Google’s $12.5 billion Motorola purchase resulted in significant losses. However, the documented destruction from blocked deals raises questions about current regulatory frameworks designed for 20th-century industrial markets. Modern technology competition often requires scale for fundamental technical reasons: AI model training demands massive computational resources, semiconductor manufacturing requires billion-dollar fabrication facilities, and global platforms need extensive infrastructure to serve billions of users reliably. The challenge lies in distinguishing genuinely anticompetitive acquisitions from partnerships that enable innovation requiring patient capital and global scale. When promising technologies fail because they lack resources to compete globally, when American semiconductor technology transfers to China through forced divestitures, and when regulatory protection leads to bankruptcy rather than independence, the framework itself requires reconsideration. A more nuanced approach would recognize that while vigilance against anticompetitive conduct remains essential, reflexively blocking consolidation while global competitors advance through strategic integration may ultimately harm the innovation ecosystem regulators seek to protect. “Soft power” proved decisive in America’s Cold War victory, with jazz ambassadors, Hollywood films, and consumer culture winning hearts and minds behind the Iron Curtain more effectively than military might could alone. [195] The State Department’s cultural diplomacy programs—from Dizzy Gillespie’s concerts in Eastern Europe to Radio Free Europe’s broadcasts—demonstrated that influence through attraction could transform global alignments without firing a shot. [196] Today, the United States faces a similar ideological competition with China, yet it has reduced foreign aid spending by 92 percent while China invests heavily in digital infrastructure across the developing world. [197] American technology companies, pursuing commercial expansion in emerging markets, now incidentally project U.S. influence in ways that echo Cold War cultural diplomacy. When countries adopt digital platforms, they import more than technology; they adopt the governance models, economic systems, and cultural norms embedded within those platforms. American companies pursuing profits in these markets create dependencies that favor open markets, free expression, and the rule of law—values essential to their business models and also aligned with U.S. strategic interests. [198] This commercial expansion generates two primary forms of soft power: cultural influence through platforms that shape global discourse and development outcomes that would otherwise require government investment. Today, the United States faces a similar ideological competition with China, yet it has reduced foreign aid spending by 92 percent while China invests heavily in digital infrastructure across the developing world. Cultural influence represents a critical dimension of soft power, shaping how billions worldwide perceive American values, consume information, and organize economically. In the competition with China for global influence, control over information flows and cultural production translates directly into strategic advantage. When populations adopt American platforms for communication, entertainment, and education, they integrate into systems that embed American assumptions about free expression, individual agency, and market economics. [199] American technology platforms have achieved unprecedented global cultural reach through purely commercial expansion. Facebook’s 3.07 billion users, YouTube’s 2.54 billion, and Instagram’s 2 billion dwarf Chinese alternatives—WhatsApp maintains 73 percent usage in middle-income countries compared with 36 percent for TikTok. [200] The creator economy is large and growing—market researchers estimate that it will reach approximately $150 billion in 2024, with projections of nearly $1.1 trillion by 2034. Separately, analysis of platform engagement indicates that U.S./English language content commands outsized global reach, reinforcing American production norms and monetization models. [201] YouTube alone contributes $35 billion to the U.S. GDP while training millions of international creators in American production methods and business practices. [202] Platform algorithms and monetization structures reinforce American cultural and economic norms without government intervention. English dominates, accounting for approximately 50 percent of online content, as creators worldwide optimize their content for English-speaking audiences to maximize revenue. [203] Netflix’s 277.65 million subscribers globally dedicate 60 percent of their viewing to U.S.-produced content. [204] These commercial systems project influence more efficiently than government programs do, though their strategic value depends on continued alignment between corporate profits and national interests. These benefits exist because commercial incentives align with U.S. interests. TikTok’s rapid growth demonstrates how quickly cultural influence can shift, and the United States cannot depend entirely on corporate platforms for cultural influence—but given competition with state-backed Chinese alternatives, failing to recognize their strategic value would be shortsighted. American foreign aid has historically served strategic purposes beyond humanitarian goals—preventing instability that breeds terrorism, building partnerships, and creating markets for U.S. goods. With the potential elimination of over 90 percent of USAID programs, removing $60 billion across 120 countries, a significant tool of American influence might disappear. Technology companies pursuing commercial opportunities in emerging markets now incidentally achieve development objectives that would otherwise require government funding. Alphabet’s health care initiatives demonstrate this dynamic. The company has screened over 600,000 people for diabetic retinopathy while building relationships with health systems for future commercialization, with plans for 3 million screenings in India and Thailand. [205] Microsoft has invested $165 million in AI for Good across 72 countries, creating Microsoft-trained workforces while addressing health challenges. [206] Digital payment platforms seeking transaction fees have lifted hundreds of thousands from poverty—in Kenya alone, mobile money has enabled 185,000 women to leave farming for business, reducing extreme poverty by 22 percent. [207] These corporate programs cannot replace government aid—they follow commercial logic, ignore unprofitable markets, and may abandon regions when business models change. Yet, their activities achieve certain strategic objectives at zero taxpayer cost, filling gaps where government programs have been eliminated. Supporting American platforms competing globally costs less than traditional aid while generating development outcomes that benefit U.S. interests. Current tech policy debates focus overwhelmingly on potential harms while ignoring documented benefits that large technology companies generate beyond their core business activities. Regulatory impact assessments measure market concentration and privacy concerns without weighing them against contributions to economic dynamism and technological progress, leading to policies that may address narrow concerns while undermining broader U.S. competitive advantages. Big tech companies generate substantial positive spillovers: their R&D produces knowledge that diffuses throughout the economy, their infrastructure investments create capabilities that thousands of businesses rely on, and their workforce programs train millions in critical digital skills. These benefits accrue to competitors, startups, and unrelated industries, yet rarely factor into policy decisions. Policymakers need frameworks that capture these ecosystem-wide effects. A regulation that reduces big tech R&D spending by 10 percent might achieve its narrow objective (e.g., collecting revenue through fines) while eliminating billions in spillover benefits. Without measuring these trade-offs, policymakers operate with incomplete information. The same applies to infrastructure investments—when regulations increase compliance costs, companies may scale back investments in data centers, submarine cables, and edge computing facilities that serve as critical infrastructure for thousands of other businesses. The global context makes recognizing these contributions urgent. China explicitly leverages its tech champions’ spillover benefits for national development, while European policies focus primarily on holding down American tech companies so EU ones can hopefully emerge. In this environment, failing to account for positive externalities means systematically undervaluing a critical source of American competitive advantage. Policy decisions should reflect complete cost-benefit analyses that include innovation diffusion, infrastructure provision, and workforce development alongside traditional regulatory concerns. Regulations designed to address narrow concerns may inadvertently eliminate billions in spillover benefits, undermine critical infrastructure development, and weaken the very ecosystem advantages that distinguish the United States from competitors. The current regulatory approach to large technology companies systematically undervalues their contributions to American economic and technological leadership. While policymakers focus on market concentration and privacy concerns, they overlook the documented positive spillovers from R&D that diffuses across industries to infrastructure investments that enable thousands of businesses, with workforce training that builds critical national capabilities. This incomplete accounting creates real risks. Regulations designed to address narrow concerns may inadvertently eliminate billions in spillover benefits, undermine critical infrastructure development, and weaken the very ecosystem advantages that distinguish the United States from competitors. China leverages its tech champions as engines of national development while Europe pursues restrictive policies aimed at constraining American companies. In this competitive environment, failing to recognize the full scope of big tech contributions amounts to unilateral economic disarmament. Effective policy requires measuring the complete impact of regulatory decisions. Cost-benefit analyses must include innovation diffusion, infrastructure provision, and human capital development alongside traditional regulatory metrics. Without this comprehensive approach, the United States risks dismantling competitive advantages that took decades to build and cannot be easily replaced. The choice is not between regulation and laissez-faire, but between informed policy that preserves beneficial spillovers and reflexive restrictions that sacrifice long-term competitiveness for short-term political gains.

Regulations Risk AI Framework Act’s Strengths and Global Best Practice Potential; New Report Calls for Amendments,2025-09-29,,"SEOUL—By uniting strategy, promotion, and regulation in a single law, South Korea’s AI Framework Act serves as a powerful policy instrument to guide the country’s artificial intelligence ambitions. But the Act’s blunt regulatory provisions threaten to undermine its strong foundations in strategy and industrial policy, jeopardizing South Korea’s long-term global competitiveness, according to a new report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s Center for Korean Innovation and Competitiveness. The Act requires substantial amendments and must be carefully implemented, according to ITIF’s report. Otherwise, its regulatory flaws—such as overly broad definitions, rigid R&D mandates, SME-first rules, invalid compute thresholds, and transparency labeling requirements—could outweigh its strengths. “This law is the first in the world to integrate AI strategy, industrial promotion, and regulation in a single statute, so it has the potential to serve as a best-practice model for other countries. But its single-instrument design also means that flaws in one policy lever will inevitably weaken the others,” said Sejin Kim, associate director of ITIF’s Center for Korean Innovation and Competitiveness (Seoul). “While the Act establishes a coordinated national AI strategy and solid industrial policies, by prioritizing procedures over performance, it undermines the scale and flexibility South Korea needs to secure a lasting edge in the global AI race.” With the Act set to take effect in January 2026 and a draft Enforcement Decree now under review by South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), the report analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the law, including its overall structure, specific provisions, and draft enforcement ordinance. ITIF calls for structural amendments by the National Assembly and balanced, practical implementation through MSIT’s final Enforcement Decree. For the National Assembly: Narrow the definition of AI, eliminate compute thresholds, redesign high-impact AI rules to focus on performance, make R&D mandates flexible, remove SME-first language, replace mandatory labeling with voluntary standards, and scale penalties proportionally with a grace period before fines. For MSIT’s Enforcement Decrees: Clarify that support is size-neutral, align oversight with sectoral expertise, safeguard confidentiality in data requests, and ensure standards are industry-led, with the government as the convenor. Among its extensive list of proposed changes, the report highlights three key priorities: Delete the compute threshold (Article 32). Computing use is not a reliable proxy for risk. Oversight should shift to post-deployment, performance-based evaluation (Article 12, strengthening AISI authority). Introduce a grace period before fines (Article 43). Companies need warnings and time to adapt before penalties take effect, followed by strong enforcement. Redesign high-impact AI standards (Articles 33–35). Replace documentation-heavy obligations with measurable performance criteria, coordinated through KRISS and sectoral ministries. “The Act’s regulatory provisions undercut its strong strategy and promotion agenda, and risk overshadowing the progress it could deliver,” said Hodan Omaar, senior manager for AI policy at ITIF’s Center for Data Innovation (Washington). “If policymakers refine how the Act defines risk, scopes obligations, and designs remedies, oversight will better target novel and consequential AI challenges without sweeping in ordinary tools. That will not only address harmful risks and provide stronger protections for Korean citizens, but also create the conditions for innovation to thrive."" As the first of its kind, Korea’s integrated model could be emulated abroad, creating a “Seoul Effect.” If regulatory flaws remain, Korea risks exporting restrictive rules that hurt domestic innovators and regional competitiveness. Conversely, if Korea makes structural fixes now and adopts balanced implementation, the Act could become a global best practice for coordinated AI policy. “The AI Framework Act will set the course for South Korea’s AI trajectory for the next decade. One-size-fits-all rules threaten to blunt those gains,” said ITIF President Robert D. Atkinson (Washington). “The way forward is decisive and practical: tighten the statute to fix structural flaws and use the final Enforcement Decrees to implement balanced, risk-based, performance-focused rules. If Korea does this, the Act will catalyze innovation that improves daily life and strengthen its industrial competitiveness.” Read the report.

"Response to NYT Guest Essay ""Google Wins, We Lose""",2025-09-29,Joseph V. Coniglio,"A recent New York Times guest essay lambasted Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for his decision in the Justice Department’s antitrust case against Google, arguing it amounted to “the meekest of punishments for abusing its monopoly of the search market,” and declaring “ Google Wins, We Lose .” Google wins? Tell that to the Justice Department, which claimed it “won significant remedies” against the company for certain search distribution agreements that were found to violate antitrust law. In fact, Judge Mehta restricted Google from entering into exclusive distribution contracts not only for search, but also for Google Assistant and Google’s Gemini app—precisely to ensure that these sorts of anticompetitive practices did not stifle competition in AI. But while restoring competition is the purpose of antitrust remedies, that does not justify a blanket payment ban that would harm other market participants and prevent Google from competing on the merits for default search placement. What’s more, Judge Mehta imposed a series of syndication and data sharing measures to aid Google’s competitors. These went well beyond anything Google proposed and were not limited due to any soft spot for Google, but to make sure that, for example, consumer privacy and security were protected with things like sharing user-side data. DOJ’s proposed breakup never made sense. What does divesting Chrome or Android have to do with Google search being the default on Apple’s browser? Judges are supposed to apply the law, not simply deliver the results desired by progressives and populists.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/29/response-to-google-wins-we-lose/
Korea's Basic AI Act Risks Stalling the Engine It Seeks to Build,2025-10-01,Sejin Kim,"Editor’s note : This column appeared in the South Korean publication TechM and is published here in English with permission. Last December, South Korea did something no other nation has attempted. It passed the world’s first law to merge AI strategy, industrial promotion, and regulation into a single statute: the Framework Act on the Promotion and Trust of Artificial Intelligence. On paper, it looks like a triumph. Korea can now claim to be the first to have an integrated framework while the United States debates voluntary guidelines and Europe wrangles over its AI Act. It is the kind of move that cements a nation’s reputation as a policy pioneer. But being first carries its own risks. By binding promotion and regulation together, Korea has created a paradox: The same law designed to drive industrial growth could also stall it. The promotional side of the Framework Act is impressive. It promises investment in data infrastructure, new AI clusters, talent training, and internationalization. These are smart, forward-looking measures that other countries will envy. They lay the foundation for an AI ecosystem capable of competing globally. The trouble comes with the regulatory provisions. Instead of targeting genuine harms, they rely on blunt, symbolic rules. Most problematic are the criteria for designating “high-impact AI.” One test is the so-called compute threshold, which automatically deems any AI model trained with more than a set amount of computational power high-risk. The metric sounds precise, but it is meaningless. Compute is not a proxy for danger. Regulating by raw processing power is like regulating airplanes by fuel tank size: It looks objective, but it tells you little about whether they are safe to fly. Articles 33 through 35, which cover high-impact AI, add another layer of concern. They impose exhaustive self-assessments, documentation, and reporting obligations. Yet endless paperwork does not guarantee safety. Results—not reports—should be the standard. That means shifting to performance-based oversight. Regulation should rest on measurable outcomes and be enforced by ministries that already have the expertise and laws to manage sector-specific risks. The Transport Ministry knows how to regulate autonomous driving, the Financial Regulator understands market algorithms, and the Health Ministry oversees medical safety. Each can set relevant benchmarks, while technical bodies such as the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science can design protocols to test compliance. Other provisions are equally misguided. Obligations for watermarking and labeling AI outputs may sound reassuring, but they will not stop disinformation, deepfakes, or intellectual property theft. What they will do is create the illusion of safety while burying firms in paperwork. The metaphor is the clock. If the regulatory clock ticks too fast, industry stalls. If it ticks too slowly, society is left unprotected. At present, Korea’s regulatory clock is running ahead of its industrial one, and the gears are grinding. Fortunately, time remains. The law does not take effect until January 2026. The Ministry of Science and ICT is now drafting the Enforcement Decrees that will determine how it works in practice. Lawmakers can still narrow the overly broad definition of “AI system,” scrap prescriptive R&D mandates, and eliminate SME-first rules that punish scale. Regulators can still drop the compute threshold, introduce a grace period before fines, and redesign high-risk AI obligations around measurable outcomes. Korea has a choice. It can show the world how to integrate strategy, promotion, and regulation in a way that builds both trust and competitiveness. Or it can serve as a cautionary tale of how regulatory overreach strangles innovation. The question is not whether AI should be regulated, but how—and at what tempo. Korea’s AI Framework Act has put its clock on display. For the Lee Jae-myung administration, which has pledged to make Korea one of the world’s top three AI powers, the challenge is not to wind the clock faster. It is to craft a precision policy clock—one in which strategy, promotion, and regulation mesh and keep time together.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/10/01/koreas-ai-law-risks-stalling-the-engine-it-seeks-to-build/
California’s Restrictions on AI in the Workplace Will Hurt Workers,2025-10-01,Daniel Castro,"California Governor Gavin Newsom made headlines this week by signing legislation requiring companies building frontier AI to disclose their safety practices , but another AI-related bill still sits on his desk awaiting his decision. That legislation, SB 7 , would restrict California employers from using AI for employment decisions. Advocates for this bill want to protect workers’ rights, but instead, they are erecting a series of unnecessary barriers to the use of AI in the workplace that will ultimately hurt both workers and employers. SB 7 would require all California employers to provide detailed notices to workers about their use of an “automated decision system” (ADS) to make employment decisions. Employers would have to provide written notice to all employees at least 30 days prior to introducing an ADS and fully explain its intended use, internal logic, types of output, performance metrics, and data collection methods, as well as detail who created the system and who will operate and interpret results. In addition, after using an ADS to make an employment-related decision, employers would have to provide another written notice to affected workers. Employers would then have to allow workers to lodge an appeal and provide them with access to any input or output data from the ADS, as well as any supporting evidence that a human reviewer used to verify the output. Finally, the bill would strictly prohibit employers from using an ADS to make compensation decisions in virtually all cases or to predict or infer an employee’s beliefs, personality, emotional state, or other behavioral characteristics. The California Labor Commissioner would be primarily responsible for enforcement, but workers could also bring their own claims against employers for violations and seek civil penalties, including punitive damages. There are many problems with this legislation. First, it is almost entirely unnecessary. Federal, state, and local labor laws, whether they be about worker protections, occupational safety, or civil rights, apply regardless of whether an employer uses AI. Employers still cannot discriminate against employees based on protected characteristics, like religion or age, and they cannot retaliate against them for engaging in legally protected activities, such as taking family leave or filing a harassment complaint. But this legislation would regulate how employers make a variety of employment-related decisions, including not just those about compensation, promotions, and terminations, but also work schedules, work assignments, productivity requirements, and training offerings, if they use AI. That creates a bizarre situation in which employers can, for example, fire workers based on completely arbitrary criteria, provided they do not use AI at any point in that decision. Ironically, this discourages employers from adopting AI systems that can actually improve workplace safety, such as tools that monitor fatigue, prevent accidents, or identify hazardous conditions. If policymakers believe workers need additional protections, they should apply those safeguards universally, not just to employers using the latest technology. Second, as with many proposed laws, this bill defines automated systems so broadly that almost any software-based tool involving data or analytics, including basic spreadsheets and simple programs with conditional logic, would fall within its scope. The bill defines an ADS as “any computational process…that issues simplified output…that is used to assist or replace human discretionary decisionmaking and materially impacts natural persons.” The bill goes on to say that employers cannot “rely primarily” on an ADS for certain employment-related decisions. While lawmakers may have thought they were preventing employers from using a Terminator -style robot to engage in mass firings, instead, they have just made it harder for hiring managers to filter out online job applicants without the necessary qualifications and supervisors to expedite annual reviews with spreadsheets. Third, the bill’s transparency requirements are a serious misstep. The rules are highly prescriptive, which makes compliance errors more common. Even trivial compliance mistakes, such as sending out notices 29 days before implementing an ADS instead of 30 days, would expose companies to serious financial penalties. The required disclosures could also reveal confidential information, such as trade secrets and the personal information of other employees. For example, consider a hypothetical ADS that recommends one worker receive a smaller bonus than more productive peers. That worker would have the right to not only obtain information about the proprietary ranking algorithm, but also all the data about their coworkers used to arrive at that assessment. On top of these issues, SB 7 would create duplicative and sometimes contradictory requirements for many California businesses. The California Privacy Protection Agency has already created its own set of onerous rules around automated decision-making under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that will go into effect in 2026. The scope of the CCPA is different because it applies to more than just employment-related decisions, but it does not apply to many smaller organizations. The CCPA also has additional requirements, including risk assessments and opt-out obligations, meaning California businesses will be tangled in red tape. Discouraging employers from using technology ultimately hurts workers by slowing hiring, reducing opportunities for advancement, and limiting access to the kinds of tools that make workplaces safer, more efficient, and more flexible. AI can help employers spot bias, tailor training, streamline scheduling, and better match workers with the right roles. Burdening companies with redundant red tape only ensures that fewer workers will benefit from these advances. California is the nation’s tech hub, and it should be leading the way in responsible adoption of AI—not putting up barriers that will leave its workers and businesses behind.

The Paramount Question: Do Countries Actually Want Growth? Competing National Priorities The Waning Growth Imperative Why Growth Must Come First Building a Growth Coalition The Bottom Line,2025-09-26,Robert D. Atkinson,"It may sound obvious, but what a nation prioritizes has a lot to do with its economic outcomes. If nations do not make growth and innovation their overarching goal, they will have less of both. This orientation, or lack thereof, influences every policy, governance, and administrative question. If growth is not the goal, robust growth will not be the outcome. It’s that simple. In a January 2025 Financial Times article on Britain’s struggle for growth, Janan Ganesh astutely comments that all the talk about growth strategies is for naught if a nation does not have a growth preference, meaning “a settled view that, when growth comes into conflict with another goal, growth must prevail.” He goes on to compare the UK and U.S., arguing: We will return to whether America has as much of a bias for growth as Ganesh suggests. But first, it’s important to note that at least five overarching goals compete for dominance in advanced economies today. Only the last one maximizes growth. At all times in history, including our own, humanity has fallen short of ideals of justice, especially in outcomes. But surprisingly, the more countries address their growth challenges and make concomitant progress on social justice, the more social justice rises to the paramount goal. By all measures—at least in OECD countries—racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual-preference justice have never been higher. Yet the focus on these issues has also never been higher. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made social justice his government’s paramount priority. U.S. President Joe Biden did the same, ensuring virtually every policy issue went through the filter of race and social justice. When social justice is the overriding goal, growth and innovation are subservient, as economic policies and regulations are shaped with equity concerns at their core. And despite what certain social-justice advocates will argue, there is almost always an inherent tension between more equity and more growth. Usually going hand in hand with social justice is the campaign to solve climate change. For green advocates, nothing is more important than fighting climate change. Everything, even growth, must be sacrificed on the altar of climate change. Al Gore epitomizes this view when he states : “The climate crisis is not a political issue, it is a moral and spiritual challenge to all of humanity.” If that is the case, everything else is secondary. Of course, the real win-win is combining social justice and green into the climate-justice movement. Naomi Klein captures this view when she asserts : “Climate change isn’t just a disaster. It’s also our best chance to demand and build a better world.” What she means by a better world is not a more prosperous one, but a more just one. Likewise, the Climate Justice Alliance “envision[s] a world in which fairness, equity, and ecological rootedness are core values.” We see this in places where voters put green before growth. In Sweden, just 12 percent of the population thinks economic growth is more important than protecting the environment, while no EU-17 nation has a rate higher than 40 percent. No wonder the EU’s main economic focus—after attacking American tech firms—is on climate. While the left prioritizes green and justice, many on the right prioritize freedom. “Live free or die,” they proclaim. They might argue that freedom leads to growth, but that’s not the case—at least compared with an effective government growth agenda. Ronald Reagan epitomized this view with his famous statement : “I hope we once again have reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited. There’s a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics: As government expands, liberty contracts.” In their zeal for freedom, these conservatives often oppose growth-inducing policies such as increased spending on science and engineering or trade restrictions on Chinese mercantilists. The new populist wing of the right pays less attention to freedom and more to family. A recent manifesto by a number of leading populist conservatives stated: Note the absence of the word growth. In fact, the manifesto opposes technologies that “replace human labor,” one of the principal sources of productivity growth. And, sounding like anti-growth guru E. F. Schumacher , they want to “accelerate the transition to a new household economy, clear away policy restrictions on home production”—something that would surely lower productivity. Yuval Levin, a signer of the anti-technology innovation manifesto, goes even further. In an analysis of Marc Andreessen’s noted pro-growth manifesto , he writes: In other words: Let’s decelerate growth. “Growthers” prioritize faster per-capita income growth driven by technological advancement. Unlike the above four goals, which are linked to political orientation (justice and green for progressives, freedom and family for conservatives), “growthers” can be found across the political spectrum. Some liberals support growth because boosting take-home pay is at the top of their agenda. Some conservatives recognize the important ways governments can facilitate growth. This gets back to Ganesh’s point. If political leaders and voters don’t put growth as number one, why be surprised when governments don’t focus on it? Wanting growth is the single most important question a nation has to answer. And by growth, I mean per-capita income growth, not just GDP growth. If we wanted to double GDP growth, we could quadruple the U.S. population with mass immigration. But what really matters is per-capita growth. So, if a government wants per-capita income growth, it should want: Organizations to boost productivity and do as much as possible with as little as possible Companies to automate as many tasks as possible Organizations to get big enough to be highly innovative and productive People who want to take risks and who are allowed to fail A tax code that promotes business investment An education system that helps gifted students become even more talented Meritocracy in education and the workplace Regulations that do as little harm to growth as possible while providing adequate social protection Public investment in the drivers of innovation and growth Social attitudes that welcome creative destruction and make it easy to build and bring new things to market For over a century, the core of American political economy was growth. Occasionally—such as during the New Deal—justice gained more prominence. But until the turn of this century, growth dominated. However, since then, growth has been on its back foot in the EU and the United States. In Europe, justice and green are the overarching priorities. Likewise, much of the Anglo world—especially Canada and the UK—has largely abandoned growth as a goal or preference in favor of equity and green. Because growth is still seen as something politicians must mention, many leaders still invoke it—but usually only to justify their other goals, especially green and justice. Ángel Gurría, former OECD secretary-general, said the perception that we must sacrifice growth to protect the environment is wrong, declaring that green can be a new driver of growth. Well, not really. Energy represents around 7 percent of most economies’ GDP, and it’s highly unlikely—absent some breakthrough in nuclear fusion—that clean energy will be any cheaper than dirty. China apologist Jeffrey Sachs claims: “The path to shared prosperity begins with justice in our economic systems. When markets operate with fairness and justice, they become powerful engines of growth.” And Jeff, your evidence is what? Technology-powered growth should once again become the West’s paramount goal. Without it, incomes—including for women, minorities, Indigenous peoples, LGBTQ+ communities, and families—will lag. Without it, societies will not be able to fund the expenditures needed to address climate change. And without it, China will win (as there is no way the CCP will let China be bogged down by the first four goals). That is a much bigger threat to Western freedom than whether the federal government is 18 percent of GDP instead of 15 percent. Ganesh got it right: Having a growth goal—or, as he called it, a growth preference—is foundational. Without it, critical questions across society, at all levels of government, and in all major political parties will be answered in ways that do not maximize growth. If this is right, it suggests that the West is stagnating because the growth imperative is under attack from both the right and the left across democratic, developed nations. Policymakers and other elites might give lip service to growth, but the underlying reality—which should be clear to any astute observer—is that this is almost all lip service. Other than the radical climate faction, who wouldn’t say they want growth? Likewise, who wouldn’t be for social justice, reducing global warming, supporting strong families, or more freedom? The point is: which one is paramount? Restoring the growth imperative will not be easy. One reason is that the imperative must span the political spectrum. Many new growthers are almost libertarian, decrying almost any role of government as freedom-crushing totalitarianism. But clearly this community—including the newly formed abundance movement , even with its free-market strains (“less regulation solves most everything”)—needs to be part of the growth coalition. So do more liberal and progressive voices, like Congressman Ro Khanna, who are committed to social justice but see growth as a key to enabling more of it. And so does the industrial union movement, which needs to get back to its roots of supporting a bigger pie, with more of it shared with working people. And finally, the community of centrist pragmatists on both sides of the aisle, who see growth as the sine qua non for achieving a wide array of goals. Whether this community can come together around a common growth agenda is not clear. It may end up more like the splinter factions in Monty Python’s Life of Brian . And given the winner-take-all partisanship in American elections, the prospects of a pro-growth centrist from either party winning a presidential nomination appear distant. So perhaps, for now, all we can do is continue to counter the non-growthers while making the case for growth. Unless we can restore the growth imperative in the West, we can—no surprise—expect slower, or in the case of some countries like Canada and the UK, negative per-capita income growth. So, are you with me?",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/26/the-paramount-question-do-countries-actually-want-growth/
One Law Sets South Korea’s AI Policy—and One Weak Link Could Break It Key Takeaways Introduction Overview of the Act Chapter 1: General Provisions Chapter 2: Governance for Sound AI Development and Trust Chapter 3: Policies for AI Development and Industry Promotion Chapter 4: AI Ethics and Trustworthiness Chapter 5: Supplementary Provisions Chapter 6: Penalties Conclusion Appendix: AI Act Summary Endnotes,2025-09-29,Sejin Kim; Hodan Omaar,"By uniting strategy, promotion, and regulation in a single law, South Korea has given itself a powerful instrument to shape AI—but its blunt regulatory mandates threaten to drag down the very strengths that make the act ambitious. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 Overview of the Act 5 Chapter 1: General Provisions 6 Chapter 2: Governance for Sound AI Development and Trust 8 Chapter 3: Policies for AI Development and Industry Promotion . 9 Chapter 4: AI Ethics and Trustworthiness 13 Chapter 5: Supplementary Provisions 17 Chapter 6: Penalties 18 Conclusion . 18 Appendix: AI Act Summary 19 Endnotes 23 South Korea’s National Assembly passed the AI Framework Act { 인공지능 발전과 신뢰 기반 조성 등에 관한 기본법 ( 약칭 : 인공지능기본법 )} in December 2024, and in doing so made South Korea the first country to fold three levers of AI policy into a single statute. [1] The act is at once a strategy to coordinate government direction, an industrial policy to promote artificial intelligence (AI) development and adoption, and a regulatory framework to manage risks. In any country, these three AI policy levers—strategy, promotion, and regulation—are interdependent: flaws in one will inevitably weaken the others. But by tying them together in one law, South Korea has given a single instrument the weight of the whole system. That makes the upside greater if the AI Framework Act (hereafter, “the Act”) succeeds, but it also raises the cost of mistakes. The Act gets the first two levers broadly right, laying the groundwork for a national strategy and treating AI as a strategic industry, but falters in its third, where blunt regulatory mandates risk dragging down the strengths of the rest. It succeeds in building a coherent strategy, correctly treating AI as a domain that demands centralized vision and coordinated investment. It also advances industrial policy in the right spirit by backing data, clusters, and adoption, though its bias toward small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) risks stifling the scale needed for global competitiveness. But in regulation, the Act falls dangerously short: it applies broad definitions that sweep in ordinary tools, imposes blunt obligations such as labeling and compute thresholds, and burdens firms with process-heavy reporting rather than performance-based oversight. The law is set to take effect in January 2026, and South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT) is working on an Enforcement Decree that details how the Act should apply in practice. On September 8, MSIT issued a draft Enforcement Decree (AI 기본법 하위법령 ) that is expected to be finalized and issued by the end of 2025. [2] Given the Act’s single-instrument design, South Korea cannot carry forward what works without also locking in what does not unless the defects are fixed now. To achieve its goals of safeguarding human rights and dignity, driving innovation that improves quality of life, and strengthening national competitiveness, the law will need targeted adjustments at two levels. The National Assembly should refine the statute to fix structural flaws, such as broad definitions, rigid research and development (R&D) mandates, and blunt regulatory triggers, that risk misdirecting oversight and constraining innovation. At the same time, MSIT must ensure that the final Enforcement Decrees translate the law into balanced, practical rules that support South Korea’s AI ecosystem without imposing undue burdens or distorting competition. The National Assembly should make the following amendments to the AI Framework Act: ▪ Amend Article 2 (Definitions) of the AI Framework Act to narrow the definition of “AI system” so that later uses of the term in the Act apply only to systems that create novel governance challenges. A more precise formulation would be: “artificial intelligence system” (AI system) means a system that, based on parameters unknown to the provider or user, infers how to achieve a given set of objectives using machine learning and produces system-generated outputs such as content (generative AI systems), predictions, recommendations, and decisions, influencing the real or virtual environments with which it interacts. ▪ Amend Articles 7 – 9 of the AI Framework Act, which cover the National AI Strategy Committee and its functions. Preserve the committee’s authority to set the national AI strategy through the AI Master Plan and to allocate resources across government AI programs but remove its power to dictate regulatory changes. Regulatory design and enforcement should instead remain with sectoral ministries that have the necessary expertise. This would keep the benefits of strategic unity at the top while ensuring that rules for medical AI, financial AI, and autonomous vehicles are crafted by the agencies best equipped to manage their specific risks. ▪ Amend Article 13 (Support for AI Technology Development and Safe Use) to remove prescriptive R&D priorities and instead empower MSIT to design and update a flexible national AI R&D roadmap. This change would let South Korea’s investments track global breakthroughs rather than be locked into outdated mandates. ▪ Amend Article 17 (SME Priority in AI Support Policies) to remove the statutory requirement that SMEs receive “priority consideration.” The law should adopt size-neutral language that enables the government to support firms of all sizes according to their strengths — allowing start-ups and SMEs to focus on experimentation and diffusion, while giving larger firms the backing they need to drive capital-intensive R&D, scaling, and global market reach. ▪ Amend Article 31 (Obligation to Ensure AI Transparency) to remove mandatory disclosure requirements. Watermarks and AI labels are technically fragile and inconsistent across jurisdictions and give a false sense of security because they do not address the specific harms that policymakers are concerned about, such as disinformation, intellectual property violations, and deepfakes. Instead, the law should direct MSIT and other ministries to promote voluntary provenance standards such as the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), invest in digital and AI literacy programs, and adopt targeted rules for specific harms such as intellectual property (IP) violations, campaign transparency, and online harassment. [3] ▪ Amend Article 32 (Obligation to Ensure AI Safety), which now triggers oversight for systems trained above a compute threshold, to remove compute as the criterion. Compute use is not a reliable predictor of risk. The law should amend Article 12 to authorize the AI Safety Research Institute (AISI) to conduct post-deployment evaluations of AI systems. AISI should test deployed models in high-impact sectors, monitor failures and incidents, and publish findings so that oversight is based on real-world performance rather than arbitrary training inputs. ▪ Amend Articles 33 – 35, which impose extensive self-assessments, documentation, and risk reporting for high-impact AI, to replace these process-heavy mandates with performance-based requirements. The law should direct each sectoral ministry to set measurable outcomes for AI systems in its domain, while the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS) should be directed to design evaluation protocols that test whether AI systems meet those outcomes. This would shift oversight from box-ticking paperwork to meaningful performance standards. ▪ Amend Article 36 (Designation of Domestic Agent) to remove revenue and user thresholds as triggers for stricter oversight of foreign firms. Oversight should be triggered only when a system is designated as high impact, regardless of whether the provider is domestic or foreign. This would ensure equal treatment, eliminate arbitrary thresholds, and ground regulation in actual risk rather than company size or location. MSIT should use its final Enforcement Decrees under the AI Framework Act to provide clarity and balance in implementation. In particular: ▪ For Article 14 (Standardization of AI Technology), clarify that standards should be industry-led, with government serving only as convenor and coordinator. Government should focus on bringing firms together, supporting participation in international forums, and aligning agencies, while leaving technical standards development to industry consortia. This would keep South Korea’s approach consistent with global practice and ensure that its firms remain competitive in allied markets. ▪ For Articles 18 (Support for AI Start-ups) and 19 (AI Convergence Policies), clarify that implementation should be size neutral. Support should continue for start-ups and SMEs through training, commercialization help, and adoption programs, but larger firms must also receive resources to expand AI use in key industries and strengthen South Korea’s global competitiveness. Funding programs, training schemes, and adoption incentives should not automatically favor SMEs but instead strengthen the entire AI ecosystem. ▪ For Article 40 (Authority to Demand Data and Conduct Inspections), set clear guidelines on what data may be requested, from whom, and for what purposes. Requests should be limited to information strictly necessary to verify compliance with the Act — such as documentation of risk management measures or user protection practices — and must never extend to unrelated business data. The decree should also require strong safeguards for confidentiality to protect firms’ proprietary information, preserving accountability without creating unnecessary compliance costs. ▪ For Article 42 (Penalties), scale sanctions according to the severity and impact of violations. Penalties should be increased for systemic or repeated breaches but remain proportionate for minor or first-time infractions. Clear guidance in the decree would ensure accountability while avoiding overly harsh punishments that discourage participation or cooperation under the Act. ▪ For Article 43 (Administrative Fines), establish a grace period before penalties are imposed. During this transitional phase, firms that fall short of new obligations should receive warnings or corrective guidance rather than immediate fines. This would give both domestic and foreign operators time to build effective compliance systems while still ensuring strong enforcement once the regime is fully in place. The AI Framework Act unfolds across six chapters. (For a chapter-by-chapter summary of articles, see the appendix.) The chapters are as follows: 1. General Provisions ( 총칙 ) , which lays out the purpose, scope, and key definitions such as “AI system,” “high-impact AI,” and “generative AI.” 2. Governance for Sound AI Development and Trust ( 인공지능의 건전한 발전과 신뢰 기반 조성을 위한 추진체계 ) , which establishes the machinery for a national AI strategy. It centers on a presidential committee, a recurring Master Plan, and support institutions such as the AI Policy Center and AISI. 3. Policies for AI Technology Development and Industry Promotion ( 인공지능기술 개발 및 산업 육성 ) , which combines innovation policies focused on R&D, data infrastructure, and standards with industrial development measures that promote SMEs and start-ups, foster clusters and data centers, and support firms’ international expansion. 4. AI Ethics and Trustworthiness ( 인공지능윤리 및 신뢰성 확보 ) , which sets the regulatory approach. It combines soft-law measures, such as ethical principles and voluntary ethics committees, with hard-law obligations on transparency, safety, oversight, and impact assessments for generative and high-impact AI. 5. Supplementary Provisions ( 보칙 ) , which sets the rules for funding and operating the Act’s programs. 6. Penalties ( 벌칙 ) , which sets penalties and administrative fines for failing key compliance obligations such as disclosing AI use, designating a domestic representative, or complying with corrective orders. This report follows the Act’s own structure: chapter 1 examines the foundational definitions that shape its scope; chapters 2, 3, and 4 take up its three core goals of building a national AI strategy, advancing industrial policy, and setting out a regulatory approach to manage risks, respectively; and chapters 5 and 6 address the operational framework and penalties. The sections that follow assess each chapter in turn, highlighting what they get right, where they fall short, and what policymakers should fix to make the framework more effective. Chapter 1 of the Act, which runs from articles 1 to 5, establishes the fundamental principles and definitions that set the legal foundation for the entire Act. Table 1 below is a summary of the key definitions from article 2 of the Act. Table 1: Summary of key definitions from South Korea’s AI Framework Act Term Act’s Definition Articles Invoked In Artificial Intelligence ( 인공지능 ”) The electronic implementation of human intellectual abilities, such as learning, reasoning, perception, judgment, and language understanding. This is the foundational term used throughout the entire Act to refer to the core technology being promoted. AI System ( 인공지능시스템 ) An AI-based system that infers outputs such as predictions, recommendations, and decisions with various levels of autonomy and adaptability. Primarily referenced in Article 32 (safety measures for large-scale AI systems) and also underpins Articles 33–35 on high-impact AI. AI Technology ( 인공지능기술 ) The hardware, software, or application technologies necessary for AI implementation. Article 6 (Government support for R&D) Article 13 (AI technology and data infrastructure) High-Impact AI ( 고영향 인공지능 ) An AI system that has the potential to significantly impact human life, safety, or fundamental rights. Article 33 (Identification of high-impact AI) Article 34 (Responsibilities for high-impact AI operators) Article 35 (AI impact assessments) Generative AI ( 생성형 인공지능 ) An AI system that generates new text, sound, images, or other outputs by imitating the structure and characteristics of input data. Article 31 (Transparency obligation for generative AI) AI Industry ( 인공지능산업 ) The industries that develop, manufacture, produce, or distribute products or services using AI or AI technology. Article 6 (Government support for AI industry promotion) AI Business Operator ( 인공지능사업자 ”) A legal entity, organization, individual, or government agency that conducts business related to the AI industry. Translates to two sub-categories: “AI Development Operator” and “AI Utilization Operator.” Articles 31–36 (This is the main regulatory subject for all “hard-law” provisions.) User ( 이용자 ) The person who receives AI products or services. Article 32 (safety measures) Article 34 (right to explanation) Article 35 (impact assessments. Affected Person ( 영향받는 자 ) The person whose life, physical safety, or fundamental rights are significantly affected by an AI product or service. Article 34 (Protections and explanations for affected persons) Article 35 (Impact assessments on fundamental rights) AI Society ( 인공지능사회 ”) A society that creates value and drives progress in all fields (industry, economy, society, culture, administration, etc.) through AI. AI Ethics ( 인공지능윤리 ) Ethical standards to be observed by all members of society in all areas of AI (development, provision, utilization, etc.), based on respect for human dignity, to realize a safe and reliable AI society that protects the rights, lives, and property of the people. Articles 27–30 (This is the main subject for all “soft-law” provisions.) One challenge with the Act serving three different goals at once is that it has to invoke “AI” in very different senses—sometimes referring to AI as a broad technology, sometimes to AI as an industry, and sometimes to specific systems that people actually use. That means the law has to be precise at every turn. In the regulatory sections, it should be crystal clear that what’s being governed are AI systems and tools in practice, not the broad technology itself. By contrast, in the strategy and industrial policy sections, it makes sense to speak more broadly about supporting AI as a field of research and technology development. To define AI precisely and appropriately, and make regulation effective for the systems that genuinely create novel risks, the law has to draw boundaries that are narrow enough to avoid sweeping in ordinary software, clear enough to provide certainty for developers and users, and stable enough to remain relevant as technologies evolve. It should capture only those technical properties that raise new governance challenges rather than generic functions such as making a prediction or recommendation. [4] South Korea’s definition—”An AI-based system that infers outputs such as predictions, recommendations, and decisions with various levels of autonomy and adaptability”—falls short on all three counts. First, it is too broad: many traditional software programs generate predictions or recommendations, but they do not introduce the novel risks that justify regulation. Second, it is vague: terms such as “AI-based,” “autonomy,” and “adaptability” lack clear technical meaning, leaving the scope open to interpretation and constant expansion. Third, it is unstable: by tying regulation to generic functions, it risks sweeping in yesterday’s tools (e.g., statistical models in spreadsheets) and tomorrow’s innovations alike, forcing endless amendments rather than providing a durable, technology-neutral foundation. ▪ The National Assembly should amend Article 2 (Definitions) of the AI Framework Act to narrow the definition of “AI system” so that later uses of the term in the Act apply only to systems that create novel governance challenges. A more precise formulation would be “Artificial intelligence system” (AI system) means a system that, based on parameters unknown to the provider or user, infers how to achieve a given set of objectives using machine learning and produces system-generated outputs such as content (generative AI systems), predictions, recommendations, and decisions, influencing the real or virtual environments with which it interacts. Chapter 2 of the Act, which runs from article 6 to 12, establishes a national AI strategy and builds the institutional machinery to give it force. Article 6 requires MSIT to establish and implement a comprehensive AI Master Plan, which serves as a national-level strategic roadmap for AI policy across all government sectors, every three years. [5] This plan sets the national direction by outlining strategies for talent development, AI ethics, investment priorities, and a national-level response to societal changes brought about by AI. To give the plan political weight and authority, articles 7–9 create a National AI Committee under the president with the power to deliberate and make decisions on critical matters such as approving the Master Plan and on R&D strategies, investment, and identifying and improving AI regulations. The law creates a clear mandate for other government bodies to act on the committee’s decisions. According to article 8, when the committee issues a recommendation or expresses an opinion for a law or system to be changed, the relevant national agency (e.g., a ministry) must establish a plan to implement the improvements. In September 2025, the government issued a presidential decree formally expanding and renaming the National AI Committee ( 국가인공지능위원회 ) as the National AI Strategy Committee ( 국가 AI 전략위원회 ). [6] It was elevated to the highest cross-ministerial decision-making organ on AI, with a new secretariat. At its inaugural meeting in September 2025, the Strategy Committee adopted four agenda items: the Korea AI Action Plan as the government’s overarching master plan (committee-led), a roadmap for establishing the National AI Computing Center (MSIT-led), draft guidelines for the enforcement decrees under the AI Framework Act (ministry-led), and the committee’s detailed operating rules (committee-led). Article 10 allows the committee to establish subcommittees, special committees, and expert advisory groups. This mechanism provides the flexibility to address specialized issues. As of September 2025, there are eight subcommittees ( 분과위원회 ) in the following domains: Technology Innovation and Infrastructure; Data; Global Cooperation; Society; Science and Talent; Defense and Security; Industrial Applications and Ecosystems; and Public-Sector Applications. [7] Each subcommittee will play a role in reviewing and aligning the government’s AI budget of 10.1 trillion won for 2026—a more than threefold increase from 3.3 trillion won in 2025. [8] Article 11 authorizes the designation of an AI Policy Center tasked with providing technical support for the Basic Plan and related policies, analyzing AI’s social, economic, and cultural impacts, forecasting future trends and legal needs, and carrying out projects assigned under law or by national agencies. The details of its designation and operation are set by Presidential Decree. Finally, article 12 establishes AISI under MSIT. The institute is charged with analyzing risks, developing safety evaluation standards and technologies, and cooperating internationally on AI safety, ensuring that citizen protection and trust remain a pillar of South Korea’s AI ecosystem. The South Korean model correctly identifies that for a technology as transformative as AI, a unified national vision is essential. The Act wisely centralizes two crucial components of an effective AI strategy: the vision and resource allocation. By establishing a presidential committee with the authority to set a single, ambitious vision, the government can ensure that all AI efforts—from R&D to public-sector applications—are aligned toward a shared goal of fueling innovation, strengthening competitiveness, and improving the lives of individuals with AI. This centralized approach also allows the government to efficiently direct capital and talent to the areas it deems most critical for those goals, preventing resources from being scattered across uncoordinated projects. This level of centralization is a strategic advantage. However, the Act goes too far by consolidating regulatory authority under the committee. By giving this single, non-sector-specific body the power to dictate regulatory changes to ministries, article 8 effectively creates a de facto master regulator. But a single body—even one supported by expert subcommittees—cannot match the deep, specialized expertise of individual ministries. The Ministry of Health understands the unique risks of medical AI; the Financial Services Commission grasps the complexities of algorithmic trading; the Transport Ministry is best placed to address autonomous vehicles. When a central regulator with broad but shallow expertise dictates rules across such diverse sectors, the results will almost inevitably misfire—too rigid for safe innovations to navigate, while being dangerously inadequate for high-risk, safety-critical applications. ▪ The National Assembly should amend articles 7 – 9 to preserve the National AI Strategy Committee’s authority to set the national AI strategy through the AI Master Plan and to allocate resources across government AI programs, but remove its power to dictate regulatory changes. Regulatory design and enforcement should remain with sectoral ministries that have the necessary expertise. This would keep the benefits of strategic unity at the top while ensuring that rules for medical AI, financial AI, and autonomous vehicles are crafted by the agencies best equipped to manage their specific risks. Chapter 3 of the Act is structured in two parts that focus on both the inputs and outputs of the AI industry. The first part addresses the foundational building blocks for industry, while the second part targets their commercialization and vitalization. The first part of the chapter, “AI Industry Foundation Building” ( 인공지능산업 기반 조성 ), which covers articles 13–15, is best characterized as innovation policy. It focuses on the fundamental inputs and infrastructure needed for a strong AI sector to emerge. Article 13 empowers the government to fund projects it believes will help the AI industry develop, including initiatives that track international technology trends and support cooperation and commercialization and a set of R&D projects focused on safety functions, privacy protection, social impact assessments, and other safeguards for rights and dignity. The Enforcement Decree proposes criteria for these projects, such as requiring that they align with national AI policy, help build and use training data, support industry growth and jobs, generate economic benefits, and be both practical and technically feasible. Article 14 authorizes the government to promote the development of standards for AI technology by creating, revising, and disseminating standards itself, as well as supporting private-sector efforts to advance standardization. It also requires the government to strengthen cooperation with international standard-setting bodies. Article 15 requires MSIT to lead policies that expand the production, collection, and use of AI training data. It authorizes the government to fund projects that build and supply datasets and specifically requires MSIT to operate a centralized platform it calls “Integrated Provision System” that manages these datasets in one place. The law says that this system should be made available for free use by the private sector, but it also authorizes the government to collect fees in certain cases, with the details to be determined later by Presidential Decree. The Enforcement Decree adds details to article 15, proposing that the platform should let users search datasets in one place, organize and track them clearly, and connect with other systems, and include checks for quality. The Enforcement Decree also proposes a legal basis for fee collection, allowing MSIT to charge different rates based on the type and use of data, while requiring exemptions for public, nonprofit, and educational users, with full rules set by ministerial ordinance. South Korea is right to recognize that government should play an active role in innovation policy for AI. The inputs needed to build a strong AI sector—R&D, data infrastructure, standards, and skills—are classic cases wherein markets underinvest because the benefits spill over far beyond any single firm. Left on their own, private actors will not build the shared foundations that allow an industry to flourish. A strong public hand in setting priorities, funding early-stage research, and ensuring that common resources such as datasets are available is essential if South Korea wants to remain competitive in AI. The intent of these provisions appears to rightly build on President Lee’s “AI Highway” initiative, which already covers infrastructure, by adding other core inputs needed to sustain South Korea’s rise as an AI leader. [9] But the way the Act implements this role needs tweaking because it risks stifling the very innovation it seeks to fuel. MSIT already has charge of the legal and managerial framework for national R&D under the National R&D Innovation Act ( 국가연구개발혁신법 ) of 2020, but the guiding strategy for the R&D itself is now being dictated by article 13 the new AI Basic Act. [10] By locking specific R&D priorities related to ethics and safety, the law effectively predetermines what government-backed research should focus on. That approach risks both steering investment toward areas that may not be the most urgent or promising for South Korea’s innovation ecosystem and leaving South Korea out of step with where global AI development is moving. A similar issue arises with standards. Article 14 rightly emphasizes the importance of standardization and recognizes the role of private-sector efforts, while also aiming to increase participation in international standards setting. These are important steps that will help South Korean firms remain competitive globally. But the text also confusingly suggests that government itself should create standards. The actual development of technical standards is best left to industry, working through recognized standards bodies, with government playing a supportive role convening, aligning, and ensuring that South Korean firms are active and influential. If government shifts from supporting to directly setting standards, it risks producing rules that lag behind industry practice and fail to gain traction internationally. [11] ▪ The National Assembly should amend article 13 (Support for AI Technology Development and Safe Use) of the AI Framework Act to remove prescriptive R&D priorities and instead empower MSIT to design and update a flexible national AI R&D roadmap. This change would let South Korea’s investments track global breakthroughs rather than be locked into outdated mandates. ▪ MSIT should ensure that the Enforcement Decree for Article 14 (Standardization of AI Technology) makes clear that standards must remain industry led, with government serving as convenor and coordinator. The ministry should focus on bringing firms together, supporting participation in international forums, and aligning agencies, while leaving technical standards development to industry consortia — keeping South Korea’s approach consistent with global practice and its firms competitive in allied markets. The second part, “AI Technology Development and AI Industry Vitalization” ( 인공지능기술 개발 및 인공지능산업 활성화 ), which covers articles 16–26, is better characterized as industrial policy. It moves beyond foundational inputs to focus on the active commercialization and growth of an AI-enabled industry. Article 16 authorizes the state and local governments to support the introduction and use of AI technology by businesses and public institutions. This can take the form of helping develop and disseminate AI products and services, providing consulting and training (especially for SMEs, venture firms, and small businesses), and offering financial assistance to cover adoption costs. The Enforcement Decree proposes specific support measures. Articles 17 and 18 prioritize smaller players in South Korea’s AI ecosystem. Article 17 requires the government to give priority to SMEs when implementing AI-related support policies, while Article 18 authorizes projects to support start-up founders, provide training, assist with commercialization and financing, and foster institutions that back AI entrepreneurs. Article 19 directs the government to create policies that encourage different sectors of the economy to adopt and integrate AI technology into their operations. It also authorizes the government to prioritize R&D projects related to this “AI convergence” within the national R&D framework, meaning that when it is deciding which research projects to fund, it can specifically choose those that involve combining AI technology with particular industries. Article 20 requires the government to improve existing systems and legal and regulatory frameworks to support the development of South Korea’s AI industry and authorizes support for research and public consultation to guide these reforms. Article 21 places responsibility on MSIT to nurture domestic AI professionals and authorizes policies to attract overseas talent. These include monitoring global AI expertise, building international networks, supporting foreign experts’ employment in South Korea, and facilitating cooperation with foreign institutions and international organizations. Article 22 mandates the government to track global AI trends and promote cooperation. It authorizes support for firms seeking to expand abroad through information sharing, joint R&D, participation in international standards, foreign investment attraction, overseas marketing, and ethics-related cooperation. Public or private institutions may be tasked with carrying out this support, with government subsidies available. Articles 21 and 22 address talent and internationalization. Article 21 tasks MSIT with cultivating domestic AI professionals and attracting overseas experts, while article 22 requires the government to track global AI trends and promote international cooperation. This includes supporting firms entering overseas markets through joint R&D, participation in standards setting, investment attraction, and marketing assistance. Articles 23 to 25 focus on promoting industrial clustering, shared testbeds, and compute capacity. Article 23 authorizes national and local governments to designate AI clusters that bring firms and institutions together, with financial, administrative, and technical support. Article 24 empowers them to establish demonstration bases where companies can test, certify, and validate new technologies. Article 25 directs the government to promote AI data centers, supporting their establishment and use, especially by SMEs and research institutions, and encouraging balanced regional development. The Enforcement Decree proposes rules for designating AI clusters, selecting institutions to run them, and defining conditions for opening testbeds to firms. Finally, article 26 creates the Korea Artificial Intelligence Promotion Association, a nonprofit corporation that promotes AI development, conducts surveys and statistics, operates joint-use facilities, supports international expansion, and runs education and awareness campaigns, with government subsidies available for its work. The Enforcement Decree proposes requirements for establishing the association and the standards for its articles of incorporation. South Korea’s approach here gets a lot right because it treats AI as a strategic industry that demands active industrial policy, not just generic support. By encouraging AI’s integration across the economy, investing in talent, and building clusters, testbeds, and data centers, the Act embeds competitiveness into multiple policy realms. This is the kind of broad, cross-cutting strategy that countries facing global competition need—one that doesn’t assume markets alone will deliver, but instead deliberately strengthens the players, infrastructure, and ecosystems that underpin long-term industrial advantage. [12] However, several of the articles in this section over-privilege SMEs and start-ups. While it makes sense for South Korea to ensure that SMEs and start-ups have opportunities in the AI economy because, as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) noted in its 2023 review of South Korea’s innovation policy, SMEs are a crucial engine of job creation and serve as a key channel for the diffusion of digital technologies throughout the economy. [13] But the Act goes too far by giving them priority treatment across industrial policy measures. A good innovation and industrial strategy should be size neutral, supporting small firms where they’re strong (nimbleness, experimentation), but also enabling larger firms to do what they do best (capital-intensive R&D, scaling, global reach). By locking SMEs into “priority consideration,” South Korea risks misallocating resources away from larger players who actually carry the bulk of AI investment and global competitiveness. Start-ups can develop new innovations, but without the scale and export capacity of larger firms, their innovations may never reach global markets. In other words, privileging SMEs may look supportive, but it could stifle South Korea’s long-term ability to build globally competitive AI champions. [14] ▪ The National Assembly should amend article 17 (SME Priority in AI Support Policies) of the AI Framework Act to remove the statutory requirement that SME’s receive “priority consideration.” The law should adopt size-neutral language that enables the government to support firms of all sizes according to their strengths—allowing start-ups and SMEs to focus on experimentation and diffusion, while giving larger firms the backing they need to drive capital-intensive R&D, scaling, and global market reach. ▪ MSIT should implement articles 18 (Support for AI Start-Ups) and 19 (AI Convergence Policies) in a way that balances support between small and large firms. That means continuing to provide training, commercialization help, and early adoption programs for start-ups and SMEs, and also ensuring that larger firms receive resources to expand AI use in key industries and to lead South Korea’s international competitiveness. MSIT should design funding programs, training schemes, and adoption incentives so that they do not automatically favor SMEs and instead strengthen the entire AI ecosystem. Chapter 4 (articles 27–36) of the Act is the cornerstone for managing the risks associated with AI. It does this in a dual approach: by setting out soft-law, ethics-oriented measures (articles 27–30) and imposing hard-law, regulatory obligations (articles 31–36). The Act takes an ethics-first approach, guiding AI development through a combination of nonbinding principles and voluntary compliance. Article 27 empowers MSIT to establish and publicly announce a set of broad ethical principles covering safety, reliability, and accessibility. While not legally binding, these principles would establish a foundational framework for the entire AI ecosystem. To promote adherence to this framework, article 28 authorizes companies, universities, and research institutes to form voluntary Private Autonomous AI Ethics Committees, which can verify compliance, investigate human rights concerns, and provide internal ethics education. Additionally, article 29 provides the legal basis for MSIT to establish an AISI, which is tasked with conducting research and development to protect citizens from potential risks posed by AI. Finally, article 30 supports voluntary verification and certification systems by directing the minister to provide relevant information, administrative assistance, and even financial aid to help SMEs meet these standards. The Act’s hard-law regulations are found from article 31 to 36 and establish a set of legally binding obligations for AI business operators: ▪ Article 31 requires AI business operators to (1) notify users when a product or service is operated by AI, (2) indicate when outputs are generated by generative AI, and (3) clearly disclose when synthetic content such as sound, images, or video has been AI-generated so users can recognize it as such. The Enforcement Decree proposes specifying that operators have to meet these obligations using flexible notice. [15] ▪ Article 32 requires AI business operators that develop or provide an AI system trained above a computation threshold (set by Presidential Decree) to establish a life cycle risk management plan, document it, and submit the results to MSIT. The Enforcement Decree proposes that this computation threshold be 10 26 floating-point operations (FLOPs). ▪ Article 33 requires AI business operators to conduct a self-assessment to determine whether their system qualifies as high impact. The draft Enforcement Decree establishes a formal process for operators to request confirmation from MSIT, with a 30-day response deadline (extendable in complex cases) and the possibility of appeal through a re-confirmation request. However, the law and Decree do not specify whether such reviews must occur regularly (e.g., annually), after significant system updates, or only upon initial deployment, leaving the frequency and triggers for review largely undefined. ▪ Article 34 requires AI business operators of high-impact AI systems to ensure safety and reliability by establishing a risk management plan, providing user protection and explanations of results where feasible, putting in place human oversight, and maintaining thorough documentation of these measures. The Enforcement Decree proposes that operators publicly post the core elements of their risk management and user-protection measures (excluding trade secrets) and retain documentation for five years. ▪ Article 35 requires AI business operators of high-impact AI systems to conduct impact assessments to evaluate potential effects on fundamental human rights. The Enforcement Decree proposes these cover groups affected, rights at risk, impacts, and mitigation plans, and allows assessments to be done in-house or by a third party. ▪ Article 36 requires that foreign companies that provide AI services to South Korean users and meet certain criteria (e.g., user or revenue thresholds) designate a domestic representative to handle compliance with the Act. The Enforcement Decree proposes that the criteria for firms be that they fit one of the following conditions: annual revenue over 1 trillion won, revenue from AI service alone of over 10 billion won, an average of more than one million daily domestic users during the most recent three-month period, or they have been ordered to take corrective action following a serious safety incident. [16] It seems clear that the intention of South Korean policymakers is to lead with voluntary, ethics-based measures and industry self-regulation. However, the regulatory obligations that follow in articles 31 through 36 undercut that approach. Instead of reinforcing the Act’s emphasis on flexibility and innovation, these provisions lean on blunt, one-size-fits-all mandates—mandatory labeling, compute thresholds, and process-heavy reporting—that misdiagnose the risks of AI and misdirect oversight. The result is the Act’s most promising elements are let down by regulatory tools that look tough on paper but will prove ineffective in practice. First, as the Center for Data Innovation explained in its report “Why AI-Generated Content Labeling Mandates Fall Short,” mandatory AI labeling such as that required by article 31 falls short for several reasons. [17] Watermarks and other marks are technically fragile and easily stripped, meaning bad actors can still spread unmarked content. Because South Korea’s law applies extraterritorially, foreign providers offering AI services in South Korea must comply, but the moment South Korean users step outside that jurisdictional bubble, they will encounter unlabeled content on foreign-hosted platforms. Instead of reducing confusion, the law risks creating a patchwork of “AI-labeled here, not labeled there” that misleads users into thinking labels are a reliable indicator of trustworthiness. Most importantly, labeling does not address the underlying concerns that motivate it—disinformation, IP theft, or harmful deepfakes—which demand targeted, problem-specific solutions rather than one-size-fits-all disclosure rules. The Enforcement Decree proposes adding flexibility to the disclosure requirements, such as by allowing nonvisible watermarking and multiple notice methods, but regulators should avoid leaning too heavily on labeling as a core compliance tool. Instead, policymakers should pivot toward building trust in digital content more broadly. That means adopting voluntary provenance standards for all content by promoting tools that embed cryptographically secure metadata so users can verify the source and history of both AI- and human-generated content. It also means investing in digital, AI, and media literacy to equip users to judge the trustworthiness of content themselves, rather than relying on labels that can be misleading or incomplete. Finally, regulators should create targeted rules for specific harms, including address disinformation, IP violations, and deepfakes, directly with problem-specific solutions (e.g., campaign disclosure rules, IP enforcement, antiharassment laws) rather than broad labeling requirements. Second, using a compute threshold to determine which AI systems should be subject to heightened scrutiny, as article 32 does, is deeply problematic. Compute only measures the amount of resources spent to train a model, not the downstream impact of how that model is deployed. As researchers at Stanford University have explained, compute does not translate into reliable predictions of real-world capabilities, emergent behaviors, or risks. [18] Compute thresholds are also clumsy in practice. Different types of AI use very different amounts of compute: a level that captures large language models might miss powerful vision models, while a lower level would sweep in many harmless systems. And importantly, models can be changed in ways that dramatically increase their impact without much additional compute, such as small adjustments during fine-tuning or training with human feedback. Finally, as chips get faster and algorithms more efficient, today’s compute thresholds quickly become outdated. In short, compute looks like an easy shortcut, but it is too blunt and unreliable to use as the main test for regulating AI. Instead of relying on blunt compute thresholds, South Korea should adopt a system of post-deployment evaluations. [19] These are assessments that take place after an AI system is deployed, focusing on how it actually performs in the real world rather than how much compute was used to train it. They can reveal risks and failures that pre-deployment testing misses, because AI behavior often changes depending on the context in which it is used. For example, a model that looks safe in the lab may perform very differently when applied in health care, finance, or education. South Korea has already established an AISI under article 12 of the Act, and it is the right body to lead this work. It should test deployed models in high-impact areas, collect and track incidents or failures as they arise, and publish clear findings on how models are functioning in practice. [20] Beyond just technical accuracy, these evaluations should look at whether outputs are understandable to users, whether they create unintended risks, and even their energy costs. That way, policymakers and the public can see how AI is really working on the ground, and South Korea’s oversight can stay flexible and targeted—something static compute thresholds will never achieve. Third, articles 33, 34, and 35 rely on transparency of process, assuming that exhaustive reports, risk documentation, and assessments will translate into meaningful accountability. But paperwork alone doesn’t ensure progress. This looks comprehensive, but in practice, it risks becoming a box-ticking exercise. Procedural rules measure whether the right steps are followed, not whether the system actually performs fairly, safely, or reliably in the real world. For AI, where risks emerge from context and usage, paperwork cannot substitute for performance. The danger is that companies will generate reports and compliance files without improving outcomes, and regulators may lack the resources or expertise to test the underlying systems. South Korea should regulate performance, not process, meaning policymakers should set performance-based requirements instead of mandating procedural checklists. [21] Regulators should focus on whether AI systems meet measurable standards of safety, fairness, and reliability once deployed. Performance-based regulation ensures that firms achieve real outcomes rather than simply check the box on compliance measures. Finally, article 36 goes in the wrong direction by singling out foreign firms. If certain uses of AI pose risks to users or society, then those risks should trigger oversight no matter who provides the service. Holding only foreign firms to stricter rules creates loopholes for domestic companies, undermines fairness, and weakens protections. Risk should be the trigger, not where a company is based. The regulatory provisions in chapter 4 risk undermining the rest of the Act. These provisions should be revisited through legislative amendment to bring them in line with the Act’s broader vision—promoting innovation, supporting competitiveness, and safeguarding citizens. The National Assembly should make the following amendments to the AI Framework Act: ▪ Amend Article 31 (Obligation to Ensure AI Transparency) to remove mandatory disclosure requirements. Watermarks and AI labels are technically fragile and inconsistent across jurisdictions, and give a false sense of security because they do not address the specific harms that policymakers are concerned about, such as disinformation, intellectual property violations, and deepfakes. Instead, the law should direct MSIT and other ministries to promote voluntary provenance standards such as the C2PA, invest in digital and AI literacy programs, and adopt targeted rules for specific harms such as IP violations, campaign transparency, and online harassment. [22] ▪ Amend Article 32 (Obligation to Ensure AI Safety), which now triggers oversight for systems trained above a compute threshold, to remove compute as the criterion. Compute use is not a reliable predictor of risk. Instead, the law should amend Article 12 to authorize the AISI to conduct post-deployment evaluations of AI systems. AISI should test deployed models in high-impact sectors, monitor failures and incidents, and publish findings so that oversight is based on real-world performance rather than arbitrary training inputs. ▪ Amend Articles 33 – 35, which impose extensive self-assessments, documentation, and risk reporting for high-impact AI, to replace these process-heavy mandates with performance-based requirements. The law should direct each sectoral ministry to set measurable outcomes for AI systems in its domain, while KRISS should be directed to design evaluation protocols that test whether AI systems meet those outcomes. This would shift oversight from box-ticking paperwork to meaningful performance standards. ▪ Amend Article 36 (Designation of Domestic Agent) to remove revenue and user thresholds as triggers for stricter oversight of foreign firms. Oversight should be triggered only when a system is designated as high-impact, regardless of whether the provider is domestic or foreign. This would ensure equal treatment, eliminate arbitrary thresholds, and ground regulation in actual risk rather than company size or location. Chapter 5 of the Act provides the operational details of the law, covering how the government will fund, monitor, and enforce its provisions. Article 37 requires the government to secure financial resources to support the AI industry, ensuring that R&D, infrastructure, and other plans are adequately funded. Article 38 mandates regular surveys and statistical reporting so policies remain evidence based. The draft Enforcement Decree (article 29) further specifies the scope of these surveys, requiring coverage of industry scale, firm revenues, workforce supply and demand, facilities, technology trends, global policy developments, and investment flows. It also allows data collection through fieldwork, literature, surveys, and electronic methods. Article 39 authorizes the delegation of duties to specialized bodies for more efficient implementation. Draft article 30 expands on this authority, enabling MSIT to entrust public institutions or associations with tasks such as supporting AI convergence projects, data center utilization, industry surveys and statistics, and even the operation of expert committees. Article 40 authorizes MSIT to demand data, carry out investigations and on-site inspections when violations are suspected, and issue corrective orders when noncompliance is confirmed. Draft article 31 provides limited exceptions, allowing MSIT to not initiate an investigation if sufficient evidence is already available or if a complaint is judged to be frivolous or intended to obstruct official duties. Finally, article 41 applies public-official accountability standards to all committee members and entrusted actors, reinforcing transparency and integrity in execution. Giving MSIT broad authority to demand data and conduct inspections risks overreach. Without clear limits, it could impose heavy burdens on firms, discourage innovation, and raise concerns about how sensitive business data is handled. ▪ MSIT should use the Enforcement Decree for article 40 (Authority to Demand Data and Conduct Inspections) of the AI Framework Act to set clear guidelines on what data can be requested from AI business operators, for what oversight purposes, and under what conditions. Requests should be limited to information strictly necessary to verify compliance with the Act, such as documentation of risk management measures or user protection practices, and should never extend to unrelated business data. The decree should also require strong safeguards for confidentiality to ensure that sensitive commercial information is protected. This approach would preserve accountability while avoiding unnecessary compliance costs and protecting firms’ proprietary data. Chapter 6 establishes penalties to enforce compliance with the Act. Article 42 imposes a penalty of up to three years in prison or a fine of up to 30 million won for any individual who leaks a business’s confidential information they obtained while performing duties under the Act. Article 43 imposes an administrative fine of up to 30 million won for three specific violations: a foreign firm failing to designate a domestic representative, a firm failing to notify a user that they are interacting with a generative or high-impact AI system, or a firm failing to comply with a corrective order issued by the government. Articles 42 and 43 do not differentiate between minor infractions and systemic harms. Treating all violations as if they pose the same level of risk could discourage experimentation, overwhelm regulators with low-level cases, and dilute focus away from serious breaches that genuinely threaten citizens or the AI ecosystem. An effective operational framework should align penalties with the scale and nature of harm, ensuring accountability without stifling innovation. ▪ MSIT should use the Enforcement Decree for article 42 (Penalties) of the AI Framework Act to scale sanctions according to the severity and impact of violations. Penalties should be increased for systemic or repeated breaches but remain proportionate for minor or first-time infractions. Clear guidance in the decree would ensure accountability while avoiding overly harsh punishments that could discourage participation or cooperation under the Act. ▪ MSIT should use the Enforcement Decree for article 43 (Administrative Fines) to establish a grace period before fines are imposed. During this transitional phase, firms that fall short of new obligations should receive warnings or corrective guidance rather than immediate penalties. This would give both domestic and foreign operators time to build effective compliance systems while still ensuring that strong enforcement takes effect once the regime is fully in place. The AI Framework Act will set the course for South Korea’s AI trajectory for the next decade. It already lays strong foundations in strategy and industry development, but blunt, one-size-fits-all rules threaten to blunt those gains.

Fact of the Week: Forty Percent of Adults in Low- and Middle-Income Economies Formally Saved in 2024,2025-09-29,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: The World Bank, The Global Findex 2025 , (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2025). Commentary: Mobile money and digital banking services, enabled by the increase in mobile phone ownership and Internet connectivity, have made banking and saving possible for many individuals located in countries without access to secure financial institutions. Globally, the number of adults holding an account at a bank or similar financial institution has increased from 74 percent in 2021 to 79 percent today. In low- and middle-income regions, particularly Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa, this growth is even more pronounced. Between 37 and 40 percent of individuals in these regions hold a mobile money account, an increase of over 50 percent since 2021. Access to these institutions has enabled more individuals to start formally saving money, with 40 percent of the population in low- and middle-income nations actively saving as of 2024, representing a 67 percent increase.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/29/forty-percent-adults-low-middle-income-economies-formally-saved-in-2024/
Don't miss tomorrow's tech industry news What California’s new AI law means for CIOs,2025-09-30,,"Tech leaders will need to adapt multiple processes to ensure providers are meeting the new standards, according to analysts. post share post print email license California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 53 , the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law Monday. The bill will have implications for CIOs and enterprises relying on some of the top AI providers. The state will require large frontier developers to publish a framework detailing how they incorporated best practices and standards into their AI models. The legislation also creates a mechanism for AI companies and the public to report critical safety incidents and protects whistleblowers who report risks posed by frontier AI models. Newsom vetoed a previous AI safety bill , SB 1047, nearly a year ago, noting that the prior bill failed to address smaller AI developers, among other concerns. SB 53 establishes two sets of requirements. The first applies to “large frontier developers,” a category defined by computing power and a high revenue threshold. The second set of rules focuses on “frontier developers” defined by computing power and complexity of the model without the same revenue threshold. “If we’re looking at just a frontier developer as opposed to a large frontier developer, there is an additional obligation regarding transparency but it’s much more circumscribed,” said Lily Li, founder of law firm Metaverse Law. The law establishes significant penalties for companies who fail to comply, with fines of up to $1 million per violation. Enterprises deploying the technology will need to be in tune with the AI frameworks to be published by large frontier AI model developers as part of the new law’s requirements. Failing to do so could mean risk for enterprises, as vendors will publicly disclose use restrictions on their models, Li said. Businesses will need to go even further by adapting procurement, compliance and risk management processes to ensure partners and internal management practices meet the California law’s requirements , said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor in the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. “Enterprises procuring AI solutions from major vendors that will now be compelled to publicly document risk management, safety frameworks, cybersecurity and governance practices will need to scrutinize these transparency reports to ensure vendor compliance,” he said. The law could also apply to enterprises running data centers or building large AI models, Schloetzer said. “Enterprises operating large data centers or fine-tuning large models in-house may be subject to certain direct obligations, such as hiring third-party auditors or reporting specific incidents,” he said. As California moves on AI laws, so are other regulators. “CIOs at large, multi-state companies should anticipate further AI rules and proactively prepare for evolving regulatory requirements,” Schloetzer said. California’s AI bill comes as federal policymakers are making their own moves to regulate the technology despite a deregulatory agenda initiated by the executive branch. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-MO, and Richard Blumenthal, D-CT, on Monday introduced the Artificial Intelligence Risk Evaluation Act, which would create an advanced AI evaluation program within the U.S. Department of Energy to evaluate advanced AI models and collect information on the likelihood of adverse events. The law would require frontier AI model developers to participate in the program. The bipartisan legislation indicates a potential shift in U.S. AI policy from a deregulatory agenda to more hands-on federal oversight of advanced AI systems that could pose national security, safety and labor market risks, Schloetzer said. “It also suggests more legislative initiatives are coming, and that the regulatory bar for deploying advanced AI solutions in the U.S. is rising,” Schloetzer said. Newsom, in a note issued with the SB 53 s igning announcement, said that if the federal government or Congress adopt national AI standards maintaining or exceeding California’s protections, further action will be taken to align the policy frameworks so businesses aren’t subject to conflicting requirements. “In enacting this law, we are once again demonstrating our leadership, by protecting our residents today while pressing the federal government to act on national standards,” Newsom wrote. The California legislation is only one of many competing AI laws being enacted in the U.S., said Hodan Omaar, senior policy manager at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation . AI vendors are opposed to a legislative patchwork of U.S. state regulations on the grounds that it creates complex compliance challenges for businesses. Meta launched a lobbying effort earlier this month to back candidates who are friendly to the tech industry and align with the company’s views on AI laws. “The more entrenched this patchwork becomes, the harder it is for Congress to assemble a coherent national framework that can actually govern frontier AI,” Omaar said 5 White House AI roadmap takeaways for CIOs By Lindsey Wilkinson • Aug. 6, 2025 purchase licensing rights",,https://www.ciodive.com/news/california-ai-law-cio/761542/

"China, Not the US, Is the EU’s Strategic Rival in Tech",2025-09-25,Matthew Kilcoyne,"With the European Commission’s newly released 2025 Strategic Foresight Report —its annual guide for setting long-term policy priorities—calling for an “EU values-based innovation model” as an alternative to the “market-driven” and “Chinese state-driven” approaches, the Commission clearly has its head in the sand. By focusing more on its techno-economic competition with the United States than with China, the EU signals a dangerous shift: embracing division among democratic allies, pushing costly protectionist policies, and leaving China positioned as the only real winner. The EU will come to regret such a short-sighted and wrongheaded approach. The report’s fundamental error lies in treating the United States and China as equally problematic. While the Trump administration’s approach towards trade, defence spending, and foreign policy may be straining the transatlantic relationship, the EU should not blur the crucial line between healthy interdependence with democratic allies like the United States and risky dependencies on CCP-run China. Doing so ignores the shared democratic values, commitment to the rule of law—including WTO commitments —and market-based principles that underpin the U.S.-EU alliance. Moreover, it further erodes the transatlantic alliance at a time when both sides should be seeking unity. China aims to gain relative global power by dominating advanced industries. As ITIF has previously documented , China has become a top innovator in key areas, including nuclear power and electric vehicles and their batteries, as well as a near-top innovator in many others, such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and quantum computing. For example, China accounts for a significant share of global AI research output and patent filings . Its lead would stem not from free-market competition but from unfair Chinese trade and economic practices. China actively uses state power to subvert international norms and rules to compete unfairly—from forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft (which costs the U.S. economy up to $600 billion annually) to state subsidies that undercut market-based competitors and regulatory frameworks designed to favour domestic champions over foreign rivals. As Liza Tobin, former China Director at the National Security Council during the Trump and Biden administrations, puts it : “the Chinese Communist Party’s ruthless pursuit of techno-economic dominance in a range of strategic sectors has distorted activities that are usually thought of as positive sum—trade and technology cooperation—into zero-sum games.” The EU has already partially recognised these realities. In 2019, the European Commission’s EU-China Strategic Outlook explicitly designated China as a “systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance,” alongside being an economic competitor. Having correctly identified China as the systemic rival, why is the EU now treating the democratic United States as an equivalent threat? The path to resilience lies in partnerships, not protectionism. Resilience comes from deep collaboration with trusted allies and fostering open markets for innovation, because only the combined United States-EU R&D expenditure creates an innovation ecosystem large enough to outpace China’s state-directed efforts. If China’s R&D spending continues to increase at the same rate as in recent years, neither the United States nor the EU will be able to match China’s level individually. China’s R&D expenditure has increased from roughly $135 billion in 2007 to $780 billion in 2023—nearly matching U.S. levels in just fourteen years with no signs of slowing . Only by working together can the United States and EU create the combined R&D spending needed to maintain a decisive innovation advantage over China’s projected trajectory. A divided effort allows China to surpass the United States while easily outpacing the EU. Partnership is the path to strength; protectionism is the path to stagnation. Deeply aligning with the United States is the only course that will effectively counter China, because fragmentation allows China to pick off weakened Western competitors one by one, while coordination prevents Beijing from exploiting divisions between democratic allies. Rather than building digital walls, the United States and the EU should lead together by deepening technological integration to ensure the dominance of Western technology that can foster growth, and by building secure, ally-first supply chains. This coordination is essential because, together, Western technological leadership creates barriers that China cannot easily replicate or infiltrate, while parallel competing systems would give Beijing opportunities to exploit gaps and inconsistencies between fragmented democratic responses. As ITIF President Rob Atkinson has previously argued , winning the techno-economic competition with China requires coordinated transatlantic approaches rather than fragmented national strategies. If China becomes the global innovation and production leader, geopolitics will change fundamentally—both Europe and the United States would be also-ran economies, with OECD nations subject to Beijing’s dictates. China could achieve sanction power over the West and threaten to cut off supplies of needed goods if Western nations do not comply with its wishes. The stakes, therefore, could not be higher. By treating the United States as just another strategic rival, Brussels is effectively doing Beijing’s work for it. The European Commission faces a clear choice: remain a serious economic power by partnering with fellow democracies or choose the comforting illusion of “strategic autonomy” and watch China dominate the technologies that will define the next century. There is no middle path between these futures. Image credit for social media preview: openDemocracy",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/25/china-not-the-us-is-the-eus-strategic-rival-in-tech/
H-1B visas have always been a scam. Trump’s changes won’t fix the problem,2025-09-24,,"45 10 min Share via Close extra sharing options Email Facebook X LinkedIn Threads Reddit WhatsApp Copy Link URL Copied! Print This is read by an automated voice. Please report any issues or inconsistencies here . The H-1B program has been exploited by companies to replace American tech workers with cheaper foreign labor despite claimed worker shortages. Among the government programs that produce more confusion than benefits, H-1B visas are right up there. If you’ve been hearing about H-1B visas, it’s probably because President Trump abruptly changed its rules with a proclamation on Friday . As is typical of Trump’s shoot-from-the-hip policymaking , the proclamation produced an outbreak of fear and chaos, in this case among holders of the visas. That’s because it seemed at first that the administration was imposing a $100,000 fee not only on applicants for the visas, but on current holders reentering the U.S. from abroad, say from home leave or a business trip. ‘This is a de facto ban, as few organizations will be able to afford it.’ — Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Until the White House clarified that the charge would be a one-time fee for new H-1B applications, not charged annually or for renewals or reentry, holders were advised by some employers not to leave the U.S. for the present; those who were caught off-guard overseas scurried to get home by Sunday, when the fee began. A Friday Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai had to abort its departure to allow several panicky passengers to disembark, according to Bloomberg . Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner. By continuing, you agree to our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy . The administration’s subsequent assurances have quelled the panic. But the proclamation has created new befuddlements, including over whether it opens the door to illicit dealings between Trump and companies bidding for the visas, and whether it’s even legal. As my colleagues Queenie Wong and Nilesh Christopher reported , there are concerns that “a selective application of the fee could be a way the White House can reward its friends and punish its detractors.” Importantly, there’s room to question whether the proclamation will solve long-standing problems with H-1B visas. So let’s take a look at the program’s malodorous history. Eugenics fell out of intellectual favor because it became identified with Nazi policies. But it has come out of the shadows H-1B visas were created in 1990, under President George H.W. Bush, to relieve what high-tech companies asserted was a chronic shortage of U.S.-born workers in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and math). The idea was to give highly-skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” the right to three years of U.S. residence renewable for a further three years — an opportunity to obtain permanent residency or even citizenship. After a few rounds of tweaking, the annual cap on new applications was set at 85,000, including 20,000 holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities. Higher education and nonprofit research institutions are exempt from the cap. Things didn’t work out as anticipated. U.S. employers came to see the H-1B visas as tools to replace native-born technicians with cheaper foreign workers. Scandalously, some of the American workers were required as conditions of their severance to train the newcomers to do their jobs. I documented that practice at Southern California Edison in 2015. The giant utility acknowledged that the outsourcing of workers would cost the jobs of 500 technicians who did the work of installing, maintaining and managing Edison’s computer hardware and software for payroll and billing, dispatching and electrical load management. Essentially, Edison was replacing domestic IT specialists earning $80,000 to $160,000 with workers provided by two India-based outsourcing firms, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, which were paying their recruits $65,000 to $71,000. By the time the outsourcing process was complete, Edison said, its IT expenses would fall by about 20%. “They told us they could replace one of us with three, four or five Indian personnel and still save money,” one laid-off Edison worker told me at the time, recounting a group meeting with supervisors. “They said, ‘We can get four Indian guys for cheaper than the price of you.’ You could hear a pin drop in the room.” Then there’s the University of California, which announced in 2016 that it would lay off 49 career IT staffers and eliminate 48 other IT jobs that were vacant or filled by contract employees. The American workers were ordered to train their own replacements, who were employees of the Indian outsourcing firm HCL Technologies. Will mass deportations make wait times at the ER get shorter and schools have more money? The truth is just the opposite Although the visa law specified that hiring foreign workers would not harm American workers, “the H-1B program is most definitely harming American workers, harming them badly, and on a large scale,” Ronil Hira of Howard University, an expert on the visa program, told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2015 . “Most of the H-1B program is now being used to import cheaper foreign guestworkers, replacing American workers and undercutting their wages.” The high-tech industry’s dirty little secret, I reported, was that the STEM shortage was a myth . The same companies wringing their hands over the supposed dearth of STEM-qualified workers were simultaneously laying them off by the tens of thousands. Indeed, experts in technology employment consistently found that “the supply of graduates is substantially larger than the demand for them in industry,” one told me. Anyway, a significant portion of H-1B recruits weren’t in jobs demanding unique skills, but workaday technicians. Since 2020, the top employer of H-1B visa holders has been Amazon, with a total of 43,375 workers over that period — followed closely by the Indian outsource companies Infosys and Tata. In the current fiscal year, Amazon reigns, with more than 14,000 H-1B holders, followed by Tata, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Apple and Google. I asked Amazon why it needs so many foreign workers and what work they do, but didn’t receive a reply. The Indian outsourcing firms have dominated the H-1B system since at least 2009. For years their role has stoked controversy, in part because their employment practices have come under question. In court, government prosecutors and civil plaintiffs have alleged that Infosys and Tata were exploiting the guest workers they brought to the U.S. Infosys settled federal fraud charges with a $34-million payment in 2013, the largest penalty in an immigration case at that time. The company denied the allegations . Alice Tornquist, a Washington lobbyist for the high-tech firm Qualcomm, took the stage at a recent Qualcomm-underwritten conference to remind her audience that companies like hers face a dire shortage of university graduates in engineering. That same year, Tata settled a class action lawsuit with a $29.8-million payment . The plaintiffs alleged that workers imported by Tata were forced to sign over their federal and state tax refunds to Tata, among other claims. The company didn’t admit wrongdoing. Over the years, the H-1B program has made for political controversy, though Congress hasn’t taken a firm hand in correcting its issues. Conservatives and progressives alike have found reason to complain that it undermines domestic employment. Near the end of his first term, Trump shut down H-1B issuance entirely, along with some other specialty visa programs, but his initiative was blocked in federal court. The program remains enormously popular in the high-tech world, which has long agitated for an expansion. Its fans include Elon Musk, who tweeted in December that “the reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B .” He underscored his position with a burst of profanity, but he did promise to “go to war on this issue,” although he acknowledged that some fixing is in order. That brings us to the issues with Trump’s proclamation. Its shortcomings resemble those that prompted federal Judge Jeffrey S. White of Oakland to overturn Trump’s ban in 2020 in a case brought by the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others. White ruled that the authority to change the terms of the visas belonged to Congress, not the president, and that the administration hadn’t evaluated the effect of the ban on the domestic economy, as federal law required. The case was rendered moot when Trump’s ban was reversed by President Biden. I asked the White House if it was concerned that this proclamation could also be blocked in court, but got no reply. Technology and the Internet Using a visa loophole to fire well-paid U.S. information technology workers and replace them with low-paid immigrants from India is despicable enough when it’s done by profit-making companies such as Southern California Edison and Walt Disney Co. A bigger question concerns the ramifications of the $100,000 fee. “H-1B visa fees of this magnitude will strongly discourage the hiring of the most talented members of the global labor force,” said University of Chicago economist Steven Durlauf. Instead, the policy will create incentives to move high-tech and scientific activity to other countries, effectively offshoring economic activity that should occur in the U.S., he said. The fee is so high that only the biggest and richest employers will be able to pay it, locking out small startups that have tried to use H-1B visas to build their professional teams. The proclamation doesn’t make clear whether universities and research institutions will be exempt from the fee. Even financially well-endowed universities would find it hard to justify paying $100,000 to import a faculty member from abroad. “This is a de facto ban, as few organizations will be able to afford it ,” says Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a high-tech think tank. The White House says it intends to replace the current system, a random lottery apportioning available H-1B slots among all applicants, with one favoring applications to fill the highest-paid slots. The proclamation states that H-1B abuses “present a national security threat by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, risking American leadership in these fields.” Never mind that students considering careers in scientific and technical fields are being profoundly discouraged by Trump’s freezes on research funding across the scientific landscape. So the bottom line is that, as is usual, Trump’s H-1B policy works at cross-purposes with his other initiatives. For decades, the H-1B program has been ripe for fixing. If only the Trump White House took the time to craft a sensible repair. Voices Hiltzik: How bad is Trump’s economy?

Times Insights delivers AI-generated analysis on Voices content to offer all points of view. Insights does not appear on any news articles. The following AI-generated content is powered by Perplexity. The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content. The H-1B visa program has been fundamentally flawed since its creation in 1990, functioning more as a tool for employers to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labor rather than addressing genuine STEM shortages. The author argues that companies like Southern California Edison and the University of California have scandalously required American IT workers to train their foreign replacements before being laid off, with Edison replacing domestic specialists earning $80,000-$160,000 with outsourced workers paid $65,000-$71,000 [1] [4] . Trump’s new $100,000 application fee represents a chaotic and poorly conceived policy that creates confusion rather than meaningful reform. The initial rollout caused panic among current visa holders who feared they would need to pay the fee for reentry, leading to aborted flights and frantic returns to the U.S. before the September 21 deadline [5] . The supposed STEM worker shortage that justified the H-1B program is largely mythical, as demonstrated by the same high-tech companies claiming labor shortages while simultaneously laying off tens of thousands of American workers. The author notes that high-tech firms cut nearly 80,000 employees in one year, including 47,000 announced layoffs from major companies like Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and Microsoft [4] . Indian outsourcing firms have systematically exploited the H-1B system, turning it into what critics call an “outsourcing visa” that enables wage theft and creates indentured servitude conditions for foreign workers. Companies like Infosys and Tata have dominated the program while facing significant fraud settlements, with Infosys paying $34 million and Tata $29.8 million to resolve legal challenges [1] [3] . The $100,000 fee essentially functions as a ban that will harm American competitiveness by deterring talented foreign workers and encouraging companies to move operations overseas. This policy particularly disadvantages smaller startups and research institutions that cannot afford such enormous fees, while potentially creating opportunities for corruption through selective fee exemptions. The Trump administration’s proclamation represents necessary reform to address longstanding abuses in the H-1B program and protect American workers from unfair wage competition. Administration officials describe the $100,000 fee as a “commonsense action” that discourages companies from “spamming the system and driving down American wages” while still allowing employers to hire “the best of the best temporary foreign workers” [5] . The new fee structure aims to curb systematic exploitation that has turned the H-1B program into an “outsourcing visa” used primarily by consulting firms to underpay foreign workers and displace American employees. Research shows that major outsourcing companies have consistently dominated H-1B usage while paying significantly lower wages than direct employers, with some firms receiving thousands of visas while filing virtually no applications for permanent residency for their workers [1] [3] . Federal enforcement agencies and policy experts argue that the current H-1B system enables widespread wage theft and creates unfair labor conditions that harm both American and foreign workers. The Economic Policy Institute has documented how companies intentionally underpay H-1B workers compared to similarly situated American employees, calling for immediate investigations and prosecutions under fraud statutes [3] . The proclamation includes provisions for national interest exemptions that could allow legitimate high-skilled immigration while blocking exploitative practices by outsourcing firms. The policy represents an “important, initial, and incremental step to reform the H-1B visa program to curb abuses and protect American workers” according to federal immigration authorities [2] . Supporters argue that raising costs will force employers to demonstrate genuine need for foreign workers rather than using the program as a cost-cutting measure, potentially transforming H-1B visas back to their original purpose of addressing actual skills shortages rather than facilitating mass replacement of American workers [5] .

How China Is Outperforming the United States in Critical Technologies,2025-09-23,Justin Riggi,"China has emerged as the leading global power in the creation of emerging technologies, dramatically outperforming the United States in the vast majority of critical technological fields. A key indicator of this is that China is dominating the United States when it comes to scientific publications. This is concerning as it threatens to erode U.S. leadership across the innovation landscape. ITIF conducted a comprehensive analysis of China’s innovation capabilities last year, and that research concluded that China’s strategic, state-backed scientific advancement across advanced sectors—driven by bold industrial policy, generous government subsidies, and ecosystem integration—has resulted in a surge of global patents, indicating it has transitioned to become a global innovation leader. China is demonstrating dominance in robotics , leading in battery supply , innovating public health by doubling clinical biotech trials , outpacing in quantum communication with a 1,200-mile QKD corridor, experiencing near-peer achievement in AI output , and narrowing gaps in semiconductors and chemicals . Similarly, according to the latest findings from Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s (ASPI) Critical Technology Tracker , which evaluates 64 critical technology categories across 8 domains (e.g., artificial intelligence and robotics), show that China leading in 57, while the United States leads in only 7 technology sub-categories. This is concerning because these critical technologies are the key input to advanced sectors that China is quickly overtaking . When evaluating the top 10 percent of high-quality scientific publications, ASPI finds that China surpasses the United States across all 8 critical technology domains. The gap is particularly pronounced in the energy and environment domain, where China accounts for 46 percent of top-tier publications compared to just 10 percent for the United States. Despite U.S. leadership in AI, China produces more top publications, contributing 30 percent versus 18 percent for the United States. (See figure 1.) Figure 1: Share of the top 10 percent of quality publications across eight critical domains China’s dominance is even more evident at the subdomain level. Across the 64 subcategories, there are multiple areas in which China leads the United States by more than 50 percentage points in their respective shares of the top 10 percent of publications. For example, China leads by 60 percentage points in hypersonic detection and tracking technologies. It holds a 56 percentage point lead in high-specification machining processes, which is a key component of advanced manufacturing. (See figure 2.) Figure 2: Subfields in which China’s share of the top 10 percent of quality publications is more than 50 percentage points greater than the U.S. share Fortunately, there are some areas where the United States retains a lead over China. In 7 of the 64 critical technology categories, American researchers produce a higher share of the top 10 percent of quality publications. Notable advantages include vaccines and medical countermeasures, quantum computing, and atomic clocks—all areas where the United States leads by at least 10 percent. Furthermore, smaller U.S. leads exist in natural language processing, genetic engineering, nuclear medicine and radiotherapy, and small satellites. (See figure 3.) Figure 3: Subfields in which the U.S. share of the top 10 percent of quality publications is greater than China’s share Additionally, ASPI identifies 24 technologies at high risk of becoming monopolized by China and another 19 at medium risk. This assessment is based on China’s share of the world’s top 10 research institutions and its publication lead over the next-closest competitor. Many of the high-risk technologies have clear defense applications, such as radar, advanced aircraft engines, drones, swarming and collaborative robots, and satellite positioning and navigation. (See table 1.) Table 1: Technologies at risk of becoming monopolized by China according to ASPI Technology Monopoly Risk Level Advanced aircraft engines High Advanced composite materials High Advanced data analytics Medium Advanced explosives and energetic materials Medium Advanced magnets and superconductors Medium Advanced optical communication High Advanced protection High Advanced radiofrequency communication Medium Advanced undersea wireless communication High AI algorithms and hardware accelerators Medium Air-independent propulsion Medium Autonomous underwater vehicles High Biological manufacturing Medium Coatings High Continuous flow chemical synthesis Medium Critical minerals extraction and processing Medium Directed energy technologies Medium Distributed ledgers Medium Drones, swarming and collaborative robots High Electric batteries High Electronic warfare High High-specification machining processes High Hydrogen and ammonia for power High Hypersonic detection and tracking High Inertial navigation systems High Machine learning Medium Magnetic field sensors Medium Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging sensors High Nanoscale materials and manufacturing High Novel antibiotics and antivirals Medium Novel metamaterials High Nuclear waste management and recycling Medium Photonic sensors High Photovoltaics Medium Post-quantum cryptography Medium Quantum computing Medium Radar High Satellite positioning and navigation High Smart materials High Sonar and acoustic sensors High Supercapacitors High Synthetic biology High Wide and ultrawide bandgap semiconductors Medium China’s progress is the result of decades-long investments in education and research aimed at building technological capability. These investments are now yielding significant returns, with implications for military, economic, and scientific leadership. China’s aggressive talent recruitment programs, such as the Thousand Talents Plan , have successfully lured foreign-educated science and technology experts to help accelerate progress in specific industries, particularly semiconductor manufacturing. Furthermore, China’s heavy emphasis on STEM education has led it to award more STEM degrees than any country in the world— more than four times the number awarded in the United States . Importantly, the Chinese government has also established strong linkages between academia, industry, and the military as part of its “Military-Civil Fusion” strategy . By eliminating institutional barriers between the civilian and military sectors, China has stimulated the rapid development of emerging technologies in service of its national defense and strategic ambitions. To adequately respond to China’s recent progress, U.S. policymakers need to once again forge productive relationships between government, academia, and the private sector that characterized the mid-twentieth century. They can start by expanding, rather than cutting, federal science and engineering research budgets. Additionally, the application process for federal grants must be streamlined to allow scientists to spend more time conducting groundbreaking research, rather than navigating bureaucratic red tape. Congress should double the R&D tax credit to better support private-sector innovation. Furthermore, given China’s momentum, the United States must adapt and take action by adopting elements of China’s innovation playbook which includes industrial research institutes, public-private capital mechanisms, expedited manufacturing incentives, and alliances on critical technology.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/23/how-china-is-outperforming-the-united-states-in-critical-technologies/
China’s Labor Productivity Growth Continues to Outpace US Growth,2025-09-22,Trelysa Long,"Labor productivity growth is arguably the foundation of economic progress. Yet U.S. labor productivity growth has stagnated in recent years, with only modest gains compared to past decades. Data from CEIC and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that China’s labor productivity growth continues to exceed that of the United States. To reverse this trajectory, U.S. policymakers should develop a national productivity strategy that draws on sector-specific analyses to strengthen productivity across all industries. Despite Chinese scholar Cai Fang’s assertion that China’s productivity gains will soon be exhausted, the reality is that China’s productivity has grown steadily over the past decade. More concerning, this growth has consistently outpaced that of the United States. From 2013 through 2019, China’s year-over-year GDP growth hovered around 6 to 7 percent, compared with U.S. growth of just 1 to 2 percent. The only exception came during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the United States temporarily surpassed China—but that growth was largely because more low-productivity sector workers were out of work. In 2020, China’s productivity rose only 2.9 percent, while U.S. productivity rose 5.3 percent. Yet despite this downturn, China rebounded strongly, hitting over 9 percent growth in 2021, while U.S. growth fell back to 2 percent. In the subsequent years, China has continued to surpass the United States in year-over-year productivity growth. Figure 1: Year-over-year labor productivity growth U.S. policymakers should develop a national productivity strategy that leverages sector-specific analyses to strengthen productivity growth across the economy. By tailoring policies to the unique challenges and opportunities of each industry, policymakers can ensure that advanced sectors remain globally competitive while also boosting productivity in the broader economy. At the same time, the Trump administration should charge the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) with a thorough review of all federal regulations that stand in the way of greater automation and technology adoption, including in housing, freight rail, and other sectors. Without such a comprehensive approach, the productivity gap between China and the United States will continue to widen, giving China more global power and the United States less.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/22/chinas-labor-productivity-growth-continues-to-outpace-us-growth/
Fact of the Week: The GDPR Led to a 13 Percent Reduction in Venture Capital Investment in the EU by US Investors,2025-09-22,Meghan Ostertag,"Source: Jian Jia, et al., “How Does Privacy Regulation Affect Transatlantic Venture Investment? Evidence from GDPR,” (Working Paper 33909, National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, June 2025). Commentary: In 2016, the European Union (EU) passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a privacy law with strict rules on how firms operating in the EU can collect, process, and store consumer data. The law came into effect in 2018, subjecting firms that violate the law to significant fines. A report by Jia et al. assesses the impact of this strict data privacy regulation on the willingness of U.S. venture capital (VC) investors to invest in European ventures. In analyzing the size and location of nearly 100,000 investment deals across the EU and the United States between 2014 and 2019, the researchers find that, after the rollout of the GDPR, the number of investment deals led by U.S. investors in the EU was 21 percent lower than the number of deals in the United States. In terms of total value, the amount invested fell by 13 percent, resulting in a $1.6 billion reduction in VC flows from the United States to the EU annually. Over time, the impact of the GDPR on VC investment has weakened, suggesting that markets have gradually adapted to the regulations.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/22/gdpr-led-13-percent-reduction-venture-capital-investment-in-eu-by-us-investors/
Comments to USTR Regarding the 2025 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy Introduction Chinese E-Commerce Platforms Facilitate Intellectual Property (IP) Infringement For the 2025 NML “Issue Focus” Consideration: USTR Should Urge More Countries To Combat Digital Piracy of Sports Broadcasts Conclusion Appendix 1: ITIF Test Purchase Results Appendix 2: How Chinese Online Marketplaces Fuel Counterfeits Endnotes,2025-09-23,Eli Clemens; Rodrigo Balbontin,"Contents Introduction . 1 Chinese E-Commerce Platforms Facilitate Intellectual Property (IP) Infringement 1 For the 2025 NML “Issue Focus” Consideration: USTR Should Urge More Countries To Combat Digital Piracy of Sports Broadcasts 5 Conclusion . 6 Appendix 1: ITIF Test Purchase Results 7 Appendix 2: How Chinese Online Marketplaces Fuel Counterfeits 8 Endnotes 8 The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) is pleased to submit the following comments for consideration by the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) for the 2025 Notorious Markets List (NML). ITIF is an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research and educational institute focusing on the intersection of technological innovation and public policy. As documented in ITIF’s August 2025 report How Chinese Online Marketplaces Fuel Counterfeits (see appendix 2), Chinese online marketplaces Temu, AliExpress, and SHEIN have become central actors in the global counterfeit economy. [1] In the summer of 2025, ITIF purchased suspected counterfeit goods from these platforms across a number of product categories, including apparel, cosmetics, toys, electronics, over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceuticals, and household goods. [2] ITIF found 25 out of 43 successfully-delivered products purchased to be confirmed or likely counterfeits (see appendix 1). [3] These counterfeits not only inflict significant harm on U.S. right holders and legitimate businesses but also pose serious risks to consumer safety and undermine fair competition. This has been documented through rights holders’ complaints and official investigations, including the Federal Trade Commission’s recent penalty against Temu for violating the INFORM Consumers Act by not adequately protecting consumers from counterfeit goods. [4] Yet despite this scrutiny, these platforms have not adopted sufficient safeguards or enforcement practices to address counterfeit trafficking at the necessary scale. Based on ITIF’s research, these platforms clearly meet USTR’s definition of markets that “engage in or facilitate substantial trademark counterfeiting or copyright piracy.” [5] Temu is owned and operated by PDD Holdings, a company headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, and has operational and logistical bases in China. [6] ITIF purchased 10 likely counterfeit products of well-known brands sold on Temu across categories such as apparel, cosmetics, toys, OTC pharmaceuticals, and household goods, often at prices far below typical retail prices. [7] ITIF found Temu’s likely counterfeits to be more sophisticated and likely more deceptive to consumers than likely counterfeits identified on other Chinese online marketplaces. Temu also alarmingly had multiple suspected and confirmed counterfeit items that pose direct health and safety risks to consumers. One example, delivered after the report’s publication, resembled dog treats from the U.K.-based pet food company NutriPaw. [8] The counterfeit packaging contained spelling errors such as “complamentary” and “beel flavor,” as seen in figure 1. Yanyankeji Local, a vendor profiled in depth in ITIF’s report, listed the product. [9] Figure 1: NutriPaw treats purchased by ITIF, product front Additionally, the brand name was misspelled as “NutrlPaw,” as seen in figure 2, and the barcode, seen in figure 3, mapped to a completely unrelated product. [10] In correspondence with ITIF, NutriPaw said “these are fakes,” and that they “had received a report of rushing their dog to the vet after giving the fake treats due to severe vomiting.” [11] Figure 2: NutriPaw treats purchased by ITIF, product lid Figure 3: NutriPaw treats purchased by ITIF, product barcode Another product purchased from the test buy, listed as “Cold Relief,” mimicked the appearance of Theraflu Nighttime Severe Cold Relief Powder, an OTC drug. [12] After ITIF submitted photos and information about the product to Haleon—the manufacturer of the authentic product—Haleon said, “It is most probably a counterfeit.” [13] Notably, Temu’s rebuttal letter to the 2024 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy said that “Temu does not sell prescription medications or any oral or injectable drugs.” [14] To Temu’s credit, the company delisted nearly every product and vendor behind it mentioned in ITIF’s report following the report’s publication, including the likely counterfeit Theraflu medicine. Yet in subsequent searches, ITIF has continued to identify additional OTC drugs available for purchase on Temu, often miscategorized under unrelated product categories. This ongoing availability underscores the gap between Temu’s public relations claims and its on-the-ground enforcement. Temu has shown commendable speed and willingness to respond to external reporting, but the company’s anti-counterfeiting enforcement still has substantial room for improvement. AliExpress.com is owned by Alibaba Group, headquartered in Hangzhou, China. [15] ITIF purchased 14 likely counterfeit goods on AliExpress, including luxury items, apparel, toys, and cosmetics. [16] For example, ITIF purchased a pair of men's shoes marketed as Brooks Ghost 15 running shoes on AliExpress for $78.48, significantly below Brooks' MSRP of $140 for the same product. [17] The seller’s listed name was ""Brooks Authorized Store,"" but in reality was the Chinese company Xiamen Bond New Material Technology, a subsidiary of Suzhou Tryan Plastic Technology (Tryan). Tryan is a plastics company whose products are used in “shoemaking” and which specializes in matching plastic colors to specific hues, according to its website. The shoes ITIF purchased had numerous discrepancies from authentic Brooks shoes, including mismatched barcodes on the shoe box and tongue, visual differences in design elements, and quality control issues with the outsole, as seen in figure 4. In correspondence with ITIF, a Brooks representative said, “I’ve confirmed with our quality teams here and can confirm this does not appear to be an authentic Brooks product.” Figure 4: Outsole detail of Brooks shoes purchased by ITIF Despite years of scrutiny, including AliExpress’s listing on the 2021 and 2022 NMLs, ITIF’s investigation revealed that counterfeit trafficking is still prevalent on AliExpress. [18] Following the publication of ITIF’s report, AliExpress delisted some of the flagged listings and a portion of the vendors named in the report, including the Brooks shoes and “Brooks Authorized Store,” but the platform’s response was overall slower than Temu’s. SHEIN is headquartered in Singapore, with corporate roots and supply chains in China, and it is owned by Roadget Business Pte. Ltd. [19] ITIF purchased one likely counterfeit luxury item from SHEIN in the report’s test buy. [20] SHEIN appears to have stronger anti-counterfeiting enforcement capabilities than Temu and AliExpress towards well-known brands’ IP, although this may be due to SHEIN’s narrower product focus on apparel and other fashion-related goods, which presents a smaller attack surface to defend against counterfeiters. [21] However, SHEIN still meets the NML’s grounds for inclusion because it allows vendors on its platform to copy independent creators’ designs to mass-produce and resell them at lower prices, undercutting original designs and small business brands. For instance, ITIF found the same design on a t-shirt originally sold on Etsy for $33.50 by the U.S.-based, women-owned design company “WE THE BABES” on SHEIN for $14.46, with minor photo alterations and no acknowledgement of the source design. [22] While SHEIN appears to have made commendable strides in its anti-counterfeiting efforts against infringement of large brands’ IP, it also appears to leave infringement against smaller—yet still important—rights holders largely unchecked. ITIF welcomes the 2025 NML’s “issue focus” examining copyright piracy of sports broadcasts. Online piracy of live events, including American sports broadcasts such as UFC matches and NFL, NBA, or MLB games, is a growing global trend. [23] Countries can protect copyright holders by allowing judicial website blocking of video streams of live events. Yet only six countries in the world currently provide this safeguard: Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay. In June 2025, ITIF released its latest report on website blocking measures to curb access to digital piracy. [24] Policies to combat digital piracy can target the demand side (i.e., minimizing piracy consumption) or the supply side (i.e., targeting pirates and their sites); website blocking measures are part of the latter, along with prosecuting the piracy networks and disrupting their financial channels. ITIF’s report shows evidence suggesting that website blocking is a particularly effective tool against digital piracy, as it reduces the consumption of pirated content and creates incentives to consume legal content. [25] Blocking pirate websites that stream sports broadcasts is particularly challenging, as the value of the event is primarily in watching it in real time, and proxy sites can appear at any moment during the transmission. Thus, protecting copyright holders in these instances requires having a legal framework that allows blocking specific websites (static blocking orders), their proxies (dynamic blocking orders), and targeting specific timeframes when the sports events occur (live blocking orders). As shown in figure 5, 50 countries allow website blocking orders. Of those, only nine countries have measures to block live events, but in three of those countries (Greece, Italy, and Spain), government agencies can issue the website blocking orders—sometimes creating procedures without public consultation. Blocking orders mandated by courts are important because they can secure due process, ensure Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not liable for their customers’ content, and balance the interests of all parties, ensuring there is no contradiction between copyright enforcement and freedom of expression. USTR should urge other countries to adopt website blocking with judicial oversight to combat online piracy, including piracy of live sports events. Figure 5. Countries allowing website blocking, by type of blocking injunction (N/A denotes not actively using) ITIF recommends that USTR include Temu, AliExpress, and SHEIN on the 2025 Notorious Markets List because all three platforms meet USTR’s criteria as notorious online markets. They facilitate systemic trafficking in counterfeit goods, harming U.S. right holders, undermining fair competition, and placing U.S. consumers at risk.

AI Is Much More Evolutionary Than Revolutionary,2025-09-22,David Moschella,"We hear it all the time: Artificial intelligence is a technology like none before, presenting unique challenges to humanity’s future. If this is true, then the fact that the great technological advances of the last two hundred years have not led to widespread job losses , societal instability, or diminished human worth is much less reassuring. Indeed, the belief that AI signals an entirely new phase of human history is central to the widespread claim that the world is entering dangerous and unchartered waters. This assertion of fundamental uniqueness is the motivation behind much of the drive for stringent and global AI regulation. But the evidence does not support the assertion, much less the further conclusion that stringent regulation is warranted. Whether we are considering the life-changing innovations of the past, the ongoing expansion of the digital technology industry, the long history of the artificial intelligence field, or even today’s debate about “narrow” AI vs. artificial general intelligence (AGI), the pattern is the same. Evolution, not revolution. Technology historians often stress the importance of general-purpose technologies : those innovations that are used broadly across many industries and serve as a platform for important societal change. In modern times there have been a half dozen or so major ones, including electricity, fossil fuel energy, motorized machinery and transportation, telecommunications, and now digital computing. Each of these technologies improved people’s lives profoundly. And while they also came with serious challenges such as safety, pollution, traffic, and climate change, the balance was overwhelmingly positive for the way the modern world lives. Looking ahead, will AI really match the societal impact of just electricity, which gave us lighting, refrigerators, washers, dryers, air conditioners, TV, radio, telecom, computers, and much more? I very much doubt it. Digital technology also has a long history of successful evolution. The idea that a powerful general-purpose computer could be based upon binary logic (ones and zeroes) goes back to the 1930s. Over the next 90 years, that core insight spawned the development of: large mainframe computers, software, data storage, smaller and cheaper minicomputers, microprocessors, personal computers, networking standards, the Internet, mobility, social media, cloud computing, Big Data, and now AI, which couldn’t exist without those earlier innovations. It’s been an impressive but steady evolution. Almost from its inception, digital technology also came with fears and challenges—unchecked automation, loss of privacy, Big Brother subservience, fraud, screen addiction, dependency on machine intelligence, misinformation, super-rich entrepreneurs, and more. But once again the benefits have vastly outweighed the downsides. This seems likely to continue, especially as for most consumers the jump from the offline world to today’s mobile, social Internet has been much more life-changing than the current jump from Google search to AI prompts. Just matching the societal impact of the Internet over the 1995–2020 period will be a very high bar to reach, let alone exceed. Similarly, AI’s rapid progress in the last few years doesn’t change the fact that its underlying ideas have been evolving for nearly a century. Alan Turing stressed the potential of algorithms in the 1930s. The mathematical logic of neural networks goes back to the 1940s. Machine learning was coined as a term and demonstrated in the 1950s. Useful expert systems were built in the 1980s. The seminal shift from symbolic and rules-based AI systems to ones based upon statistics and probability goes back to the 1990s. Google’ s DeepMind unit demonstrated the power of deep learning in 2016 when its AlphaGo program defeated Lee Sodol in Go. It’s been a long and evolutionary process. While there have been important recent improvements, the core ideas behind AI have been with us for many decades. The reason that amazing and highly useful AI systems have only recently emerged isn’t because of any fundamental technological breakthrough; it’s the availability of zettabytes of Internet training data, much greater processing power, and inexpensive cloud computing and data storage. Inevitably, today’s impressive AI capabilities have triggered 2001: A Space Odyssey -type fears. But once again they’re not convincing. Human oversight is still needed in just about every complex field that matters—be it medicine, law, defense, software, academia, or scientific research. AI alone cannot grow our food, build our roads, or fix our plumbing. Those who sincerely fear an AI future might concede many of these points. But they could counter that the dangers will become more obvious once AI moves from its narrow to generalized phase. But alas, that transition is also likely to be an evolutionary, not revolutionary story. While there are various tests and concepts, there is no sharply defined boundary between narrow AI and AGI, and the distinction between these two terms will surely fade away over time as AI systems become more flexible, with much improved memory, accuracy, and self-awareness. It’s unlikely that there will be any single event, development, or moment when the world suddenly agrees that AGI has arrived. As with the technology fears of the past, AI’s risks—the unintended consequences of autonomous systems, deepfakes, control by rogue actors, et al.—will be real, but for the foreseeable future they will be manageable in the much same way that every important technology has been in the past—through evolving rules, practices, and system refinements. While it’s easy to imagine a dystopia where super intelligent and highly dexterous legions of robots dominate and revolutionize life on Earth, that’s still the realm of science fiction, where technology fears have always found a home. In short, evolutionary technology requires evolutionary, not revolutionary responses.

Further Comments or Observations 6 Endnotes 7 On July 3, 2025, the European Commission (Commission) launched a public consultation on the first review of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to assess the “effectiveness of the legislation.” [1] The purported rationale for enacting the DMA was to ensure fair and contestable digital markets within the European Union (EU) by regulating the conduct of large online platforms designated as gatekeepers, as well as safeguarding the ability of business users—particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)—to compete. [2] The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), the world’s top-ranked science and technology policy think tank, greatly appreciates the opportunity to respond to this important public consultation. As its responses to the Commission’s questions attest, ITIF does not believe that the DMA is an effective tool of competition policy. On the contrary, the DMA has resulted in demonstrable consumer welfare losses, chilled procompetitive behavior, and even harmed small businesses. What’s more, it has done so by imposing obligations and penalties that inexcusably target America’s leading technology companies, thereby straining the critical transatlantic bonds that are essential to ensuring Western techno-economic leadership in the 21st century amid the threat posed by China. With important exceptions and qualifications, the current list of core platform services generally encompasses services that are in some way related to those markets that have been subject to antitrust investigations and/or enforcement by the Commission and/or EU member states over the past several decades. But both the relatively more established—albeit nonetheless highly dynamic—nature of these markets, as well as claims that traditional competition law enforcement proved unable to adequately police anticompetitive conduct in these industries, do not exist as grounds to justify the application of the DMA to the AI foundation model and cloud markets that are empowering the next wave of digital innovation. As ITIF has explained, these markets are not only highly competitive and growing rapidly, but they do not demonstrate signs of market failure or an inability for regular competition law to address any anticompetitive behavior that may arise. [3] ITIF understands that the Commission’s motive in enacting the DMA was to further its longstanding competition policy objectives, including the flawed ordoliberal model that has contributed to the innovation-driven productivity gap with the United States. [4] Regardless, both the intent behind and effects of the DMA are demonstrably discriminatory against America’s leading technology companies. [5] Specifically, while even SMEs in terms of revenue can enjoy substantial digital market power, the DMA’s revenue thresholds for designating gatekeepers are, as MEP Andreas Schwab made clear, designed to limit its scope to the top five American technology companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Indeed, of the more than twenty CPSs designated under the Act, only two involve non-American companies. And of course, the actual enforcement of the DMA only confirms its discriminatory and anti-American intent, as all of the investigations and fines that have been announced under the DMA so far have been against American gatekeepers. This targeting of U.S. firms has not been well received by the Trump administration, who named the DMA in a memorandum warning against the unfair exploitation of American companies. [6] The per se bans put forward by the DMA are chilling procompetitive behavior without providing any clear and offsetting benefits in terms of limiting false negatives that ex post enforcement tools are unable to address. The most striking example involves the application of Article 6(5)’s ban on self-preferencing, which, for instance, limits Google’s ability to integrate its search and maps services efficiently. As ITIF has highlighted, a recent consumer survey confirmed not only that 35 percent of respondents believe Google’s maps service has degraded, but that approximately 60 percent have found that Google search has worsened due to an increased number of clicks required to access the desired content, with 33 percent of respondents also finding less relevant results. [7] Moreover, as a result of Article 6(5), search traffic has been directed to Google’s large intermediary competitors often at the expense of the small businesses (e.g., restaurants and hotels) that EU competition policy is ostensibly designed to protect—potentially resulting in as much as a 50 percent reduction in their online traffic and millions of euros in revenues. [8] Troublingly, certain DMA obligations are being enforced in ways that exceed the scope of the Commission’s already broad competition policy goals. For example, the DMA’s prohibition in Article 5(2), which prevents gatekeepers from combining user data across services without consent, served as the basis for a €200 million fine against Meta’s “consent or pay” model, despite no pretext of harm to competition. Rather, the Commission decided to use the DMA as de facto privacy regulation and attack practices that have not even been found to violate the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). [9] As studies have found, this sort of privacy regulation that reduces ad effectiveness is likely to result in negative consumer welfare effects vis-à-vis reduced investments in advertising, higher product prices, and even greater market concentration. [10] Indeed, less efficient advertising is not just likely to harm advertisers—many of whom are small businesses—but also users, with research finding that 80 percent of EU consumers prefer fewer but more targeted ads as opposed to those that more frequent and more random. [11] As a regime focused on prohibiting exclusionary conduct, the Commission’s power under Article 18 to impose structural remedies is wholly unnecessary. In fact, not only will behavioral remedies almost always be adequate to address anticompetitive behavior, but structural relief is likely to impose costs that far outweigh any remedial benefits. Second, heavy-handed fines issued under Article 30(1)(a) that are punitively designed to deter future violations, such as those the Commission has already imposed upon Apple and Meta, should not be considered appropriate as the DMA is an ex ante regime that gives the Commission the ongoing power to essentially approve or sanction a gatekeeper’s business practices. Moreover, punitive fines are also ill-advised given that, in view of what studies have called the “opaque and administratively complex” procedural framework put forward by the DMA, it may be difficult for a gatekeeper to even know whether or not it is in compliance, let alone deliberately engage in illegal practices. [12] Indeed, reports suggest that Apple made a series of good faith remedial proposals to the Commission over a period of many months without receiving any feedback, which is thoroughly inconsistent with the Commission issuing punitive fines against the company. [13] While the DMA is intended to prohibit anticompetitive conduct and thus could be deemed a form of “light touch” regulation, it is unfortunately being implemented in a way consistent with far more intrusive public utility regulation that seeks to dictate market outcomes. For example, in enforcing the effective interoperability obligation under Article 6(7), the Commission is not just forcing the Apple to comply with a non-discrimination regime that micromanages its product design decisions without any attempt to focus on protecting as efficient competitors, but is imposing a series of measures that will harm consumers and developers—many of whom are SMEs—through increased privacy and security risks. [14] Similar concerns about reduced privacy also exist with the DMA’s data portability requirements under Article 6(9)), with commentators noting research finding that over 75 percent of applicants are outside the EU, where privacy policies are often more lax. [15] Innovation has also suffered: not only was Apple forced to delay the rollout of Apple Intelligence, but the release of new features for AirPods Pro3 have similarly been withheld in Europe. [16] The DMA is imposing heavy and overly burdensome compliance costs on gatekeepers. Overall, industry estimates suggest that the annual cost for an American gatekeeper to comply with the DMA is approximately $200 million. [17] At bottom, that is $1 billion in resources American gatekeepers are allocating to Europe each year for compliance with the DMA that could be used to productively invest in Europe’s economy, including in European startups who significantly rely on foreign investments especially for late stage funding. [18] For context, Meta had already reportedly spent over 590,000 working hours on compliance as of the March 2024 deadline. [19] Moreover, in addition to also spending hundreds of thousands of hours on compliance, not only is Apple, as a result of connected device interoperability requirements, being required to effectively white-label new features by providing them to connected device competitors at the same time it makes them available to its own integrated products, but it is also being tasked to create and maintain a database of its over 250,000 APIs—a significant and wholly disproportionate compliance burden on the company. [20] National implementing efforts risk undermining the DMA’s goal of providing a uniform competition enforcement regime for digital markets across the EU. As ITIF stated in its submission to the Italian Competition Authority on its draft harmonization regulation, the proposed approach would have granted the its competition agency investigatory powers beyond those envisioned by the DMA, created a substantial risk of parallel enforcement and a violation of the ne bis in idem principle, and contributed to regulatory fragmentation. [21] Indeed, the landmark Draghi Report itself highlighted how Europe’s position in innovative sectors can be hindered by regulatory fragmentation and a broader “rising weight of regulation.” [22] As documented in their extensive compliance reports, American gatekeepers have been and continue to be heavily engaged in substantial good faith efforts to comply with the DMA. For example, Google has implemented myriad changes across its search and Android platforms, including over 20 modifications to its search service to benefit comparison sites, additional choice screens on Android, and new user consents when data is shared across services. [23] Furthermore, along with the interoperability measures noted above, Apple has reconfigured its mobile platform to enable alternative app distribution and allow for alternative payment processors—all while doing its best to mitigate the increased risks to security and privacy. [24] Moreover, Meta both substantially lowered the price of its subscription option and introduced an entirely new “Less Personalized Ads (LPA)” business model that allows European consumers to enjoy its products for free while using significantly less data for purposes of personalized advertising. [25] Similarly, Amazon implemented new user consents for data sharing, increased third-party access to consumer and seller data, and enhanced prior antitrust commitments to the Commission regarding its own use of seller data. [26] Finally, Microsoft has also made substantial changes to comply with the DMA, including allowing users to uninstall Edge and Bing using the standard Windows uninstall process, increasing platform access for third-party web search applications and developers, along with implementing new practices to limit the use of third-party data and ensure user consent. [27] As a non-profit dedicated to supporting evidence-based policies to drive innovation and Western techno-economic leadership, ITIF is particularly concerned that the DMA will not just continue to have adverse consequences for innovation and consumer welfare, but—through its intentional targeting of America’s leading technology companies—will also place undue strains on a transatlantic alliance that is essential to countering China’s quest for global techno-economic dominance. As ITIF has explained, for Europe: [D]eeply aligning with the United States (creating a “G2”), is the only course that will be effective in countering China. This means the United States and the EU dialing back recent protectionist actions, including U.S. steel tariffs (for which both the Trump and Biden administrations have been completely in the wrong on) and EU “digital sovereignty” actions that discriminate against U.S. firms. The two regions should however go much further and resurrect and pass a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that would eliminate all tariffs on products traded between nations and eliminate most if not all regulatory barriers to trade and investment. On top of this, both regions should establish much closer cooperation in areas of science and technology, foreign development assistance, and commercial counterintelligence against China. And most importantly the two regions should create a “demand alliance” focused on advanced technologies or inputs which would insulate markets from unfairly produced Chinese goods. [28] While the DMA remains in its infancy, early evidence concerning its impact and effectiveness suggests that it is already doing substantial damage to the European economy. For example, one report from LAMA Economic Research found that the DMA could result in revenue losses of up to €114 billion, or 0.64 percent of the total turnover of the regulated sectors. [29] This finding is consistent with, as ITIF has noted, the observations of “leading European economists, legal scholars, and consumer advocates warn[ing] that [the DMA] is degrading user experience, stifling innovation, and placing new burdens on smaller firms, all while jeopardizing Europe’s global competitiveness and straining ties with the United States.” [30] Indeed, these observations include admissions by leading advocates of digital antitrust regulation that the DMA’s purported benefits of limiting the power of gatekeepers are few, if any, with one leading voice stating that the DMA is “not a real challenge to the platforms’ core status” and promotes “mostly competition on the platform, not competition to the platform.” [31] At bottom, while resulting in myriad harms to the European economy, concrete evidence of the supposed benefits of the DMA remains lacking. Unfortunately, but consistent with Europe’s soft power—and in particular with respect to shaping competition policy standards around the world—a “Brussels Effect” has resulted in the DMA becoming a global model for digital antitrust regulation. [32] As such, the European Commission may be said to have a special responsibility to ensure that its competition policy, especially in the digital sphere, is both conducive to the continued development of the digital economy worldwide and does not serve as a justification for the global targeting of Western technology companies to the benefit of China, whose own digital champions are increasingly the primary beneficiaries of digital antitrust regulation.

"Trump’s De Facto H-1B Ban Will Boost the Trade Deficit, Reduce US Competitiveness, and Have No Impact on Unemployment",2025-09-22,Robert D. Atkinson,"MAGA Republicans have long criticized the H-1B visa program that lets U.S. organizations hire high-skilled foreign workers on a temporary basis, arguing it takes jobs away from Americans. So, it wasn’t surprising to see President Trump issue a proclamation on Friday requiring any organization petitioning to employ an H-1B worker to pay a $100,000 fee. The White House says the fee will have to be paid when companies submit petitions for new H-1B visas—which are typically good for a renewable three-year term—while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described it as an annual fee at the announcement ceremony. But either way, let’s be clear: This is a de-facto ban, as few organizations will be able to afford it. And the result will be that traded-sector companies will hire more workers overseas, while the other workers who would have come to America will instead work for foreign competitors of U.S. companies. And to the extent any companies do pay the fee, their cost structure will go up relative to foreign competitors. As a result, domestic U.S. technology capabilities and competitiveness will decline. The H-1B program enables employers facing a shortage of domestic talent in specialty occupations to hire foreign workers, granting them temporary work authorization. The number of these visas that are available is capped at 85,000 per year, and Congress allows the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to impose a modest administrative fee to cover the cost of processing them. (As such, Trump’s proclamation is probably illegal and could be overturned in court.) If the president is worried about some organizations abusing the H-1B program and hiring skilled foreign workers when they could be hiring skilled American workers, then instead of trying to impose a fee on visa petitions a better solution would be for Congress to allow USCIS to auction off the 85,000 visa slots to the highest bidders. Or Congress could impose a base fee of something like $25,000 and have the cap on the number of visas issued per year be unlimited. Organizations that truly need them will bid up the price and win the auctions, and organizations that can find skilled American workers to hire for less than the auction price plus salary and benefits will do that instead. The current lottery system leaves too much to chance. If a U.S. company has 10 positions it needs to fill with foreign workers, it would have to submit applications for two or three times as many visas, knowing that many applicants will not be approved. The lottery system also means that U.S. companies cannot ensure they are always hiring the best of the best foreign workers—instead, they are just getting the luck of the draw. Creating an auction for H1-B visas would provide companies with more certainty. Critics complain that employers only use the program to undercut American workers’ wages. But consider that the average wage for H-1B workers is $149,000, far above the U.S. median wage. And the wages also differ considerably, with U.S. high-tech firms paying considerably more. For example, Google’s average wage is $179,000, Meta’s is $199,000, and Apple’s is $200,000. Indeed, a scholarly, peer reviewed study of the H-1B program in 2010 shed new light on the debate about its impacts on the labor market. The study found IT professionals with an H-1B or other work visa earn on average 6.8 percent more annually than IT professionals who have U.S. citizenship. When the authors controlled for the state in which the IT professionals work and for job titles, the premium declines, but is still significant at 2.6 percent. Outside of the IT sector, the Milwaukee Board of School Directors employs 351 workers with H-1B visas, paying them $78,000 . Evidently, that includes 275 international teachers . The program is also used to bring in nurses and similar human services occupations, which can be a lose-lose proposition. Some of these visas take scarce and valuable workers who could be providing education and nursing services in developing nations that need them, and substitute them for Americans when there would be no real shortage of teachers or nurses if not for the modest salaries. Lots of students can get degrees in these fields. It doesn’t require Calculus 2. A visa auction program would lead these organizations to hire Americans and apply market pressure to raise their salaries. Also, a significant share of H-1B visas go to IT offshoring firms that do most of their work overseas and need some workers here, including to interact with clients. Again, an auction program would likely reduce their share. There are, however, legitimate shortages of U.S. STEM workers, and putting a de-facto ban on H-1B visas would make several things more likely to happen. First, these American tech firms competing in global markets would instead just hire these workers overseas, either as remote workers (much easier after Covid) or in a foreign affiliate office. The result would be fewer American jobs and a worse trade balance. The reason it would mean fewer jobs is that H-1B visa workers spend their salaries domestically at restaurants and movie theaters, buying cars, etc., which creates U.S. labor demand. If they are overseas, that U.S. labor demand is not created. Meanwhile, the reason trade balance would be harmed is that these workers will be overseas, but still paid by American companies, leading to increased imports (in this case, foreign labor services). At the same time, the increased difficulty in hiring STEM workers would mean that U.S. companies would at the margin become less competitive than foreign counterparts, including Chinese companies. Critics of the H-1B program miss a broader and deeper point: Too many American workers are not high-caliber due to the poor quality of the U.S. education system, including colleges. H-1B opponents assume that a worker is a worker is a worker, and that if companies need a worker for a particular task, they can just hire an American. Secretary Lutnick made this point at the signing ceremony, saying : “If you’re going to train somebody, you’re going to train one of the recent graduates from one of the great universities across our land. Train Americans, stop bringing in people that take our jobs.” Ah, if only it was that simple. First, comparatively few Americans get STEM degrees—and many who try don’t finish. Indeed, according to the Department of Education, only 41 percent of students who had begun STEM majors in higher education ended up obtaining a STEM degree of any kind in 2009. Part of the explanation is likely inadequate preparation in high school. As of 2016, more high school students in California were taking ceramics than computers science, according to state data . In 2022, 15-year-old U.S. students ranked 28th out of 37 OECD member countries in math. In the 2011–2012 school year 40 percent of first-year undergraduate students at four-year institutions in the United States took at least one remedial course. The reality is that most graduate students in STEM— 72 percent of computer science graduate students, and 74 percent of electrical engineering students—are foreign-born. More broadly, American students don’t perform very well compared to foreign peers. During his 2024 run for the Republican presidential nomination, Vivek Ramaswamy got into hot water for saying the obvious: He went on to point out: “Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence,” and, “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math Olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers.” But you are not supposed to say that, so he was vilified. While China’s team won this year’s world math Olympiad , America earned second place thanks to a team comprised of students from Asian families. Similarly, most of the students at specialty math and science academies like Thomas Jefferson in Northern Virginia were from Asian families—at least until parents protested and the School Board eliminated the admissions test . In 2006, 20 percent of U.S. college students completing four-year degrees—and 30 percent of students earning two-year degrees—had only basic quantitative literacy skills, meaning they were unable to estimate if their car had enough gasoline to get to the next gas station, or calculate the total cost of ordering office supplies. Literacy among those college graduates is also quite low. In 2006, among seniors at four-year U.S. colleges, more than 50 percent of students did not score at the proficient level of literacy. In 2005, only 31 percent of college graduates could read a complex book and extrapolate from it. As the saying in college goes: The students pretend to learn, and the professors pretend to teach. The students pay good money to demand and receive “A’s” in response. Saying America has great universities is a good sound bite, but saying it doesn’t make it true. Of course, the response to this reality for decades has been to push for improving U.S. education. But if anything, education is getting worse, especially as universities compete intensely for fee-paying consumers (er, students). But even if we could waive a magic wand and improve education, employers wouldn’t realize the benefits for another two decades. But there is one more factor, intelligence. Anyone who says intelligence does not matter for STEM jobs and knowledge jobs more broadly has not worked in these fields. One does not need to be an Einstein, but workers with above-average intelligence are, let’s face it, on average more valuable to an employer than workers with below-average intelligence. The distribution of IQs in the population is on a bell curve, so 16 percent of people are at or above one standard deviation from the mean (that is, above 115, with 100 being average), and just 2 percent are gifted at 130 or above. That means that there are around 34 million working age Americans above 115, and 4 million above 130. Contrast that to the rest of the world which has 846 million above 115 and 106 million above 130. So, if you are an employer and you want smarter employees, it is natural to be open to hiring foreign individuals, especially because the unemployment rate for high-IQ individuals already in the United States is likely extremely low. So, does anyone really think that America would not be vastly better off with 85,000 highly skilled foreign workers moving here per year? The United States would be stronger, more innovative and more competitive, especially against our adversary China, with more overall high-paying jobs. So, it’s time for real debate about this issue. We can turn inward and protect a relatively small number of American workers at the cost of weakening republic, or we can allow U.S. employers to recruit the best and brightest from around the world and have a more innovative and stronger republic. As a patriot, I choose the latter. Image credit: Mathematical Association of America (MAA)",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/22/trumps-de-facto-h-1b-ban/
Five Persistent Myths About Big Tech Myth #1: Big Tech Creates Nothing of Value Myth #2: Big Tech Has Been Harmful to Workers Myth #3: Big Tech Doesn't Invest Myth #4: Big Tech Enjoys Entrenched Monopoly Power Myth #5: Big Tech Spends Disproportionately on Lobbying and Has Captured Washington The Dangers of Misplaced Anger,2025-09-19,Giorgio Castiglia,"The Trump administration’s “America First” antitrust policy signals a return to normalcy on some fronts but also carries forward the anti-tech neo-Brandeisian agenda of the Biden administration. While tech companies should by no means be excluded from scrutiny when it comes to issues such as anticompetitive practices, pervasive myths remain about the digital economy, which the “New Right” has in some instances helped perpetuate. Antitrust policies predicated on these myths will hobble innovative companies with undue burdens, reduce consumer welfare and economic growth, and help cede U.S. technological leadership to China. While ITIF has elaborated elsewhere on these myths and the harm they cause, this blog highlights five of the most prevalent with respect to Big Tech companies. In his book The Tyranny of Big Tech , Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) laments the rise of Big Tech firms, claiming that “they produced almost nothing” and that they “extracted nearly all their value as economic rents from a customer base held hostage to their monopoly control.” The problem with Senator Hawley’s argument is simple: It couldn’t be further from the truth. For instance, field experiment research conducted by Erik Brynjolfsson, Avinash Collis, and Felix Eggers studied the value of free online services and found that Facebook alone provided an estimated $225 billion worth of value to users between 2004 and 2018. Although this value, and the value created by zero-priced digital goods more generally, does not show up in GDP statistics, the authors explain that adding only the value created by Facebook during that time would have raised yearly GDP growth by 0.11 percent. Moreover, the experiment found that the median individual would have required $17,000 per year to give up online search services, for which they currently pay $0. This is an incredible amount of value that is not reflected in GDP. In addition, a forthcoming report by ITIF’s Aegis Project demonstrates the many ways, beyond the information sector, that Big Tech companies create massive value for society through investment and risk-taking. Another common myth circulated among the American public is that Big Tech has been harmful to workers and employment. As Hawley claims in his book, these companies generate “enormously high returns—while employing a tiny number of workers, all things considered.” Since when did employing more workers than a sector needs to serve U.S. consumers become a good thing? By this logic, Senator Hawley should support the historic practice of “featherbedding,” where unions required employers to hire more labor than necessary to perform minimal work. More generally, many contend that increased technological progress will lead to automation that reduces employment. Again, when did productivity become bad? Surely Senator Hawley does not want a stagnant, Luddite economy. Moreover, not only is it true that Big Tech companies compensate workers well, but they also create many jobs in the United States indirectly. Worrying about how labor-saving technology affects employment is nothing new—and is as overblown as ever. For example, full-time “digital creator” employment, which gave workers additional opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic, grew from 200,000 to 1.5 million between 2020 and 2024, a 650 percent increase. This growth is enabled and supported by the platforms and operating systems created by Big Tech companies. These jobs often have flexible hours, high earning potential, and remote work possibilities that support families. A common attack on Big Tech platforms is that they are able to maintain high profits without having to invest significantly because they are protected from competition by high entry barriers, switching costs, and network effects. However, recent research shows that Big Tech platforms have continued to invest significantly in R&D over time. In fact, a new Antitrust Law Journal article by Jorge Padilla, Douglas Ginsburg, and Koren Wong-Ervin provides data on R&D expenditures by firms in several major sectors of the economy. They find that absolute expenditure on R&D by Big Tech companies increased 19 percent annually between 2000 and 2022 and has far outstripped other industries. As a percentage of revenues, R&D spending for Big Tech was as high in 2022 as it was in 2000, about 13 percent, even though their revenues have grown dramatically. Indeed, Alphabet—parent company of Google—alone spent over $45 billion on R&D in 2024, according to the EU’s R&D Scoreboard . All these facts belie the claim that large tech platforms are resting on high rents and maintaining high profits by reducing investment. That Big Tech enjoys entrenched monopoly power is a commonly repeated, yet easily refuted, claim. Vigorous rivalry across the tech industry continues to abound, as these large firms put steep competitive pressures on one another in many markets. For example, Google and Amazon offer competing comparison-shopping services; Apple and Google compete in the market for mobile devices; Google, Amazon, and Meta compete strenuously in digital advertising; Microsoft, Amazon, and Google have an intense rivalry in cloud computing; and so on. Moreover, all the web platforms compete fiercely for user attention and engagement, which are the primary sources of their revenue. In addition, not only do they compete with one another in existing markets, but they are all competing vigorously in the new wave of AI innovation, which is disrupting their preexisting business models and requiring them to remain on the cutting edge—or face obsolescence. Finally, much is made of the fact that Big Tech firms are among the highest total spenders on lobbying. For some, this constitutes Big Tech’s “unmatched lobbying power” and “unchecked influence.” This claim is often asserted as proof that Big Tech has captured Washington and that we are living in a “ Tech Oligarchy .” However, as ITIF has previously demonstrated , Big Tech firms spend no more on lobbying as a percentage of revenues than firms in other industries do, many of which pool their lobbying resources in trade associations, such as those for realtors, health insurance companies, and auto dealers. Moreover, rather than having engaged in successful regulatory capture, these firms have continued to be the targets of monumental antitrust cases since the first Trump administration. Indeed, the second Trump administration has moved forward with cases against Big Tech and inquiries into its power with the same gusto as the Biden administration. Wayward antitrust policies influenced by these anti-Big Tech myths are liable to harm innovation and economic growth. Big Tech companies create enormous value for consumers, support new employment opportunities across the economy, and invest tremendous resources in R&D. Furthermore, dynamic competition through innovation disrupts powerful incumbents and safeguards the economy from stagnation at the hands of entrenched monopoly power. Big Tech firms that drive much of this progress should therefore not be unduly targeted through antitrust policies, particularly if they are based on demonstrably false claims.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/19/five-persistent-myths-about-big-tech/
European Consumers Are Right to Complain About the DMA,2025-09-19,Matthew Kilcoyne,"European consumers report a worse online experience since the Digital Markets Act (DMA) took effect, according to a recent survey of 5,000 people by Nextrade Group , a firm specialising in digital trade research. This perception is not just subjective—the DMA required companies to make functional changes to their digital products and services in ways that directly align with consumer complaints. The findings underscore how, when regulators rather than the private sector dictate technology design, consumers ultimately lose out. First, the survey found that 35 percent of respondents believe map services have worsened since early 2024, the compliance deadline for many of the companies the European Commission designated as “ gatekeepers ” under the DMA. And they have. Before the DMA, Google Search blended effortlessly with Google Maps. Users searching for “hotels in Paris,” for instance, would see an interactive map, complete with photos, ratings, real-time availability, and prices—all accessible directly from the search page, with the option to save favourites in one click. The integration ended when the DMA designated both Google Search and Google Maps as core platform services under Alphabet’s gatekeeper status. Under Article 5(2) , Google cannot “combine personal data from the relevant core platform service with personal data from any further core platform services,” while Article 6(5) says it “shall not treat more favourably, in ranking and related indexing and crawling, services and products offered by the gatekeeper itself than similar services or products of a third party.” To comply, Google had to disable clickable maps in search results , remove the Maps tab from the search bar , and require explicit user consent to link the services together . The result is a less fluid experience, where seamless discovery has been replaced by fragmented steps and reduced functionality. Second, the survey found that consumers believe search has worsened since the DMA, with 62 percent saying it now takes longer to find what they are looking for online, and 33 percent reported that results are less relevant. These concerns link directly to changes forced on companies by the DMA. Before the law, Google Search had a rich, all-in-one interface: restaurant searches showed maps with locations and reviews, shopping queries offered product comparisons with images and pricing, local business searches displayed hours and contact information, and movie and TV show queries produced showtimes and streaming availability. But under Article 6(5) , Alphabet is prohibited from treating third-party services appearing in Google’s search results less favourably than with Alphabet’s own and must provide “fair and non-discriminatory” treatment. Article 5(2) also prohibits combining data collected from two different services belonging to the same company, which applies to Alphabet’s designated core platform services, including Google Search. To understand what complying with a maximalist interpretation of this requirement would entail, Google tested a reversion to a basic “ ten blue links ” format—the simple list of website links that characterised early search engines, stripped of the rich information panels, images, maps, and integrated data that users have come to expect. As a result, users had to click through multiple pages to gather the same information they once found instantly, explaining why many now report longer, less relevant searches. Third, 42 percent of frequent travellers say flight and hotel searches have become less helpful since the DMA took effect. Before, travellers using Google Search could see comprehensive, integrated results showing prices, availability, ratings, and booking options—all in one seamless interface. Users could compare options, view real-time pricing, and access booking information without leaving their search results. But under the DMA, gatekeepers must not treat their own services more favourably in ranking than similar services of third parties. To comply, Google has made more than 20 modifications to Google Search to boost comparison sites for flights and hotels. As a result, more traffic now flows to intermediaries, like Booking.com and Expedia, which charge commissions, while direct bookings from free Google links have fallen, with hotels reporting a 30 percent drop in clicks. Fourth, 25 percent of working Europeans report that finding relevant job opportunities has become harder since the DMA took effect. Before the DMA, LinkedIn could seamlessly integrate features across the platform, creating personalised recommendations based on comprehensive user profiles. Users scrolling through their feed might see “Jobs You Might Be Interested In” perfectly aligned with their career path, powered by data from their searches and connections. However, the DMA’s prohibition on combining data collected from two different services belonging to the same company applies to LinkedIn as a core platform service under Microsoft’s gatekeeper obligations. As a result, the platform can no longer automatically integrate professional activity across its Jobs, Marketing Solutions, and Learning services without explicit user consent. Now, users must opt in to this integration. Many may skip this step—tapping “no” to avoid friction—without realising the negative impact it ultimately has on their user experience. The DMA’s push for consent at every turn adds small frictions that accumulate and can ultimately break features users value. Overall, the survey highlights a clear pattern: European consumers are most frustrated where the DMA dismantled features. Those upset about maps had lost access to useful integrations, while users reporting longer searches or poorer travel-related results now face less efficient results due to banned integrated features. The DMA forced companies to roll back successful innovations, not market failures. More disruption is coming. Apple is designated as a gatekeeper “in relation to iOS, App Store, and Safari” and “in relation to iPadOS” and it must comply with Article 6(7) requirements for “effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the same hardware and software features.” As a result, Apple’s new live translation feature for AirPods won’t be available in the EU at launch due to these interoperability requirements. The evidence is clear: The DMA has not improved consumer outcomes and has instead made many users worse off by forcing unwelcome changes on the digital products and services they rely on.

US tech giants pledge $42 billion in UK investment as Trump tours Blighty,2025-09-17,,"America and the UK have announced a $42 billion (£31 billion) trade pact, funded by Microsoft, Google, and others, that predicts bit barns will spring up over Britain's green and pleasant Land. But there's a lot more than money involved. The Brits are billing the Tech Prosperity Deal as a ""historic"" event in transatlantic trade cooperation. Besides infrastructure spending, the two nations will set up technology sharing agreements in the fields of AI, quantum computing, and nuclear research, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. ""This Tech Prosperity Deal marks a generational step change in our relationship with the US, shaping the futures of millions of people on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said in a statement . ""By teaming-up with world-class companies from both the UK and US, we’re laying the foundations for a future where together we are world leaders in the technology of tomorrow, creating highly skilled jobs, putting more money in people’s pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom."" Officials clearly worked out the trade pact far in advance of the announcement, which came within hours of President Trump arriving in the UK at the start of his second official state visit. The US president spent his first day hobnobbing with the royal family, leaving no time to chat with the UK Prime Minister about it. But the government release shares some interesting, and occasionally disturbing details about what exactly is involved in this Anglo-American tech embrace. The headline-grabbing part of this deal is the cash investments by big tech companies and their suppliers. The deal is primarily about funding, although whether it's a product of deal making or just a coordination of investment strategy releases is up for question. ""Whether it's something that 'companies would have done anyway' is impossible to know, but it does represent significant new investment which could lead to job creation and economic benefits,"" Stephen Minton, IDC's group VP of data and analytics, told The Register . ""My initial reaction was that it could lead to tangible benefits in the next 5-10 years, depending on execution and attracting more investment. This deal alone isn't going to drive a hyper-surge in UK GDP growth, but I don't see anything negative in it, and it could be a step towards attracting more AI investment to the UK."" Microsoft is ponying up the most cash, going on a $30 billion (£22 billion) spending spree in the UK over the next three years to build data processing and AI bit barns. This is in line with Redmond's strategy. Britain was the home of its first European office back in 1982, and it's been building out in the UK for a while , with more than 6,000 staff in the country now. Microsoft said this was the biggest investment round for the UK in its history, according to the government statement. It's not clear where they'll be spending the cash, as datacenters are sited based on a wide variety of factors related to cost and available infrastructure, but the company's biggest HQ is in Reading, just outside London, and the company's current datacenters operate in London and nearby, as well as in Wales. Microsoft pens $15B love letter to the UK with 23,000 Nvidia GPUs attached Google unmasks itself as mystery hyperscaler behind yet another UK datacenter UK.gov decides tech projects worth billions are major but not 'mega' Small nuke reactors are really coming online by next year, US energy secretary insists The deal press release also cites Google, which is investing $6.83 billion (£5 billion) in building datacenters over the next two years. However, this plan has been in the works since last year. They just hadn't stated where yet, but today we learned it was just outside London's infamous M25 ring road. Salesforce is chucking $2 billion (£1.4 billion) at the Brits in the announcement, an increase from its $4 billion five-year investment plan announced in 2023. The funding is going for R&D and AI datacenters, but Salesforce's first bit barn is in, you guessed it, the heart of London. It's a similar story with the $683 million (£500 million) promised by private equity biz Blackrock. A fifth of that sum is going to be spent in datacenters just to the west of London, although it states it's also investing in ""datacentres across the country."" Scale AI is also spending $53 million (£39 million) on expansion in the UK. However, this will be to expand its European headquarters in the nation's capital. The exceptions to the London-centric rule are Coreweave, which is building a bit barn in Scotland, and then OpenAI and Nscale, who plan a UK center for the Stargate AI project in the economically-depressed northeast of England. While Nvidia is not investing directly, the AI shovel-maker has allocated 120,000 GPUs to the country, which the government claims is its biggest European GPU commitment to date. This number includes ""up to"" 60,000 Grace Blackwell Ultra GPUs specifically for the Stargate UK project. Aside from the geographically spotty investment strategy, there's more in the trade deal that could have a direct impact on the UK. The deal will ""make it quicker for companies to build new nuclear power stations by speeding up the time it takes for a nuclear project to get a license,"" the UK government said. While micronuke reactors are all the rage in the US at the moment, it's unclear how Brits will feel about having mini-piles next door. They are needed – the UK's power infrastructure is creaking under the strain of yet more datacenters and some off-the-grid output could ease the load on the power network. The deal also includes working on nuclear fusion, adding the UK's brain power to the race, much as it did with fission in the 1930s and 40s. But this looks more like a statement of interest rather than a serious proposal. The same looks to be true for quantum. The two countries will establish a joint taskforce to investigate quantum technology, but there are no firm goals or investment plans stated. When it comes to AI, the word historic gets chucked around a lot, but there's no real promise of actual technology exchange. Instead, we get the usual task forces and consultant committees that seem so prevalent in the science section of the bill. Specifically, the nations will collaborate on using AI in health care, space exploration, and nuclear fusion, the release said. The long-term effects of the trade pact have huge potential, if they are carried out. It all depends on whether both sides are willing to put in the necessary resources and expertise. ""Leadership in this technology among allies is not a zero-sum contest,"" said Ayesha Bhatti, head of digital policy for the UK and EU at the Center for Data Innovation. ""The UK is securing major investment in its AI infrastructure and advancing its AI-powered public service agenda, while the US is deepening collaboration with one of the world’s strongest research partners"" Others disagree. Nick Clegg, the former deputy Prime Minister and Meta flack , said the deal was a bad one for Britain, as it relies on US companies to build on British soil, rather than investing in homegrown competitors. ""In a sense, this US-UK tech deal is just another version of the United Kingdom holding on to Uncle Sam’s coat-tails,"" he told the Royal Television Society conference on Wednesday, saying it made Britain a ""vassal state."" ""We just have to be a little bit more realistic about our predicament and a little bit firmer about what we can do ourselves, rather than what I think we’re seeing with this US-UK tech deal – which is basically just taking sloppy seconds from Silicon Valley."" ® AI United Kingdom AI United Kingdom AIOps BBC Brexit British Armed Forces DeepSeek ESA Five Eyes Gemini Google AI Government of the United Kingdom GPT-3 GPT-4 Large Language Model London Machine Learning MCubed Neural Networks NLP Parliament of the United Kingdom Retrieval Augmented Generation Scotland Star Wars Tensor Processing Unit TOPS EMEA Europe Self-driving Car AI United Kingdom AI United Kingdom AIOps BBC Brexit British Armed Forces DeepSeek ESA Five Eyes Gemini Google AI Government of the United Kingdom GPT-3 GPT-4 Large Language Model London Machine Learning MCubed Neural Networks NLP Parliament of the United Kingdom Retrieval Augmented Generation Scotland Star Wars Tensor Processing Unit TOPS EMEA Europe Self-driving Car Send us news",,https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/17/us_uk_trade_deal/
"Breakdown, Not Breakup: Taking Stock of the Google Remedies Decision",2025-09-18,Joseph V. Coniglio,"Judge Amit P. Mehta of the District Court for the District of Columbia has issued his opinion on the remedies Google should face following his earlier decision that several of its agreements with browsers, Android OEMs, and wireless carriers to pre-install Google search as the default had anticompetitively maintained a search monopoly. Judge Mehta grappled with the complex legal questions involving the appropriate antitrust relief for a monopolization case and applied them to the even more intricate and dynamic facts presented in the remedies trial held months before. While Judge Mehta’s opinion was a mixed bag regarding the behavioral measures levied on Google, by rejecting the DOJ’s radical divestiture proposals, the decision is not only a win for Google but also a death knell for the anti-business, anti-growth neo-Brandeisian movement. As Judge Mehta recognized, antitrust remedies serve three core purposes: unfettering the market from anticompetitive conduct, denying the fruits of the antitrust violation, and ensuring that there remain no practices likely to result in monopolization in the future. In addition, the type of antitrust relief can take two broad forms: structural remedies that would break up Google or behavioral measures that impose obligations on Google with respect to its business practices. And with respect to behavioral relief, Judge Mehta rightly distinguished between the more typical prohibitory injunctions that prevent Google from partaking in certain behaviors and affirmative obligations that would require Google to undertake certain proactive measures. The most straightforward remedies imposed by Judge Mehta were those prohibitory injunctions that served the purpose of unfettering the market from anticompetitive conduct. Importantly, this relief included not just bans on the specific practices found to be unlawful, but also other provisions that prohibited conduct similar in nature to that which was found to be anticompetitive (and even for products other than search). Here, Judge Mehta largely accepted Google’s proposed relief in its entirety, agreeing to forego default distribution agreements that were found to be anticompetitive not just for search but also other ancillary products, such as Chrome and its GenAI solution Google Assistant Gemini (for Android OEMs and carriers). He also included Google’s proposed restrictions on other related practices that were not found to be anticompetitive, such as preventing Google from conditioning the distribution of one product (e.g., search) on the preferential placement of another (e.g., Gemini). In justifying these additional prohibitory injunctions to unfetter the market from anticompetitive behavior, Judge Mehta asked the right question: whether they represented a “reasonable method of eliminating the consequences of the illegal conduct” and would promote competition—the latter condition precluding a ban on nonexclusive payments for search distribution to browsers given the harms that would result to third parties and consumers. However, when considering the DOJ’s request to restore competition using structural relief—namely, a divestiture of Chrome and a potential divestiture of Android—Judge Mehta rightly applied a more rigorous test. As he explained, not only are breakups untethered to the conduct found to be anticompetitive, unnecessary to restore competition, and in fact counterproductive (e.g., loss of synergies with Google’s broader operations), but a higher causation standard that asked whether Google would have maintained its monopoly “but-for” its anticompetitive behavior was simply not satisfied. Judge Mehta applied a similarly high standard when assessing the various remedies put forward by DOJ to serve another remedial purpose: ensuring there remain no practices likely to result in monopolization in the future. This included relief requested by the DOJ to prevent Google from engaging in self-preferencing that advantaged its search or GenAI products, as well as a host of other anti-circumvention, anti-retaliation, and administrative remedies, such as requiring Google to provide notice of acquisitions for certain types of companies. Judge Mehta’s legal grounds for rejecting them were simple: that such practices merely “could” prove anticompetitive in the future was not a basis to outlaw them—more certainty was required. Indeed, the one instance of self-preferencing that Judge Mehta evaluated in the liability phase was not even found to be anticompetitive. So far, so good—the legal standard applied was proportional to the type and purpose of the relief requested. In determining which affirmative obligations Judge Mehta should impose on Google, much therefore depended on whether he would apply a heightened legal standard, like the ones he used to evaluate structural relief and remedies aimed at preventing future dissimilar monopolization. Alternatively, he could apply the more relaxed “reasonable method” test he used to condone the additional prohibitory injunctions as a valid means of “eliminating the consequences” of Google’s illegal conduct. Indeed, in evaluating the syndication remedy, which requires Google to provide competitors with its organic search results and features, Judge Mehta went with the lower standard, arguing that it was a “‘reasonable method’ of addressing the effects of Google’s anticompetitive acts.” As Judge Mehta explained, the various data-sharing remedies he imposed on Google fundamentally serve a different core remedial purpose. That is, rather than unfetter a market from anticompetitive effects, they “are designed primarily to deny Google a key fruit of its anticompetitive conduct.” For Judge Mehta, chief among these fruits were Google’s network-driven scale economies, which he viewed a series of data-sharing remedies as a “reasonable method” of counteracting. But more should have been required to justify this relief: While he attempted to respond to Google’s objections concerning the extent to which “the fruits of a violation must be identified before they may be denied” in reference to the key Microsoft v. Massachusetts case, where Massachusetts sought tougher remedies against Microsoft following its settlement with the DOJ, Judge Mehta overlooked that greater scrutiny should have applied to determine whether the data-sharing remedies properly denied Google ""the products of the unlawful practices which the defendants have inflicted on the industry,"" as opposed to scale benefits it achieved through procompetitive means. While a milestone, the search remedies decision is anything but the end of the long-running DOJ v. Google search matter. Not only will Google likely appeal Judge Mehta’s remedies ruling, but it will also appeal his underlying liability decision, finding that the company acted anticompetitively. However, what does seem clear is that while the reasoning in Judge Mehta’s remedies opinion may have broken down when it came to the critical issue of data sharing, the raison d'etre of the neo-Brandeisian movement to break up Big Tech now seems somewhat of a pipe dream. That is, not only will Google’s search, browser, and mobile businesses remain intact, but Judge Mehta’s analysis of the rigorous legal standards that apply when sanctioning structural relief proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that other potential antitrust breakups involving Google Ad Tech or Meta should be unlikely even if the government ultimately prevails on the merits. In short, while Judge Mehta’s opinion may be one small step forward for Google, it is one giant leap toward defeating the neo-Brandeisians’ agenda to break up Big Tech.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/18/breakdown-not-breakup-taking-stock-google-remedies-decision/
The FCC Has No Mandate to Police Speech in the ‘Public Interest’,2025-09-19,Joe Kane,"TV and radio broadcasters have licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)—“and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,” according to FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who has often insinuated threats to the licenses of companies that broadcast views with which he disagrees. Most recently, Chairman Carr argued that a September 15 broadcast of a Jimmy Kimmel monologue —in which Kimmel said “the MAGA gang [were] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them”—was incompatible with licensees’ public interest obligations. Carr went on to say, “we can do this the easy way or the hard way.” The implication was that broadcast content should change, or the FCC would go after broadcasters’ licenses. But as Joe Kane writes in Broadband Breakfast , it isn’t that simple. As the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, the “public interest” standard is limited by the text of the Communications Act. Therefore, it doesn’t have the breadth to support Chairman Carr’s threatened actions. Rather, such actions would likely run afoul of a constitutional rule known as the nondelegation doctrine, not to mention the First Amendment .

"Hey, AI Job Doomers: Wanna Bet?",2025-09-18,Robert D. Atkinson,"When I was younger, my older brother and I would constantly make bets over disagreements. “Wanna bet? Wanna bet?” We did, and I usually lost. I’m reminded of that every time I read luminaries who predict AI will destroy jobs. It makes me want to say: “Wanna bet?” In July, Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla warned that AI will be able to perform 80 percent of any job within five years, and that by 2040 people won’t need to work to survive. As The Wall Street Journal reports , “CEOs are no longer dodging the question of whether AI takes jobs. Now they are giving predictions of how deep those cuts could go.” Predicting massive job destruction has become the fashionable way to show you “get it” and sympathize with the so-called huddled masses. And it’s not just job loss; it’s inequality, too. A Stanford professor recently told me we are headed toward a two-tier society, with elites using AI while everyone else is reduced to a kind of lumpenproletariat. These claims are not only wrong; they are deeply troubling. Their main effect is to gin up fear and loathing, and we all know what comes next: calls for AI regulation and taxation, as Nobel Prize-winning economist Daron Acemoglu has urged . Slowing AI adoption would be a disaster, given America’s three major economic crises: The massive budget deficit (which the Big Beautiful Bill only made worse) The demographic crisis of retiring boomers The anemic rate of labor productivity growth Taken together, these paint a bleak picture—fiscal strain, entitlement pressures, and stagnant wage growth. You’d think that now, when we finally have a general-purpose technology capable of boosting productivity growth, leaders and pundits would be cheering AI on, not scaring the living @%$$ out of workers. Claims that AI-driven job destruction is inevitable could not be further from the truth. In reality, if we’re lucky, AI will boost U.S. labor productivity growth from around 1 percent a year to 2 percent. That additional income will be spent across the economy, supporting workers of all kinds, such as personal trainers, college professors, carpenters, and more. We need more CEOs like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, who rightly calls such doomsday predictions “overly alarmist.” So, in the spirit of those childhood bets: AI doomers, wanna bet $100 that by September 2027 there will be more white-collar jobs in America than there are today? Any takers, especially CEOs and VCs? Vinod, if you want to take my bet, it’s only about 0.0000011 percent of your net worth.",,https://itif.org/publications/2025/09/18/hey-ai-job-doomers-wanna-bet/
GTIPA Perspectives: How Smart Deregulation Can Unleash Powerful Innovations Worldwide Introduction Country Case Studies Full Report Endnotes,2025-09-22,Stephen Ezell; Mario Ottero Cricco,"The mounting economic costs of burdensome regulations that exact far more costs than benefits on societies—and which in many countries have led to unchecked regulatory accumulation—and the adverse impact on innovation, productivity, and long-term growth they cause.

The Alliance exists to collectively amplify members’ voices and enhance their impact on trade, globalization, and innovation policy issues while introducing new scholarship into the world on these subjects. Among their shared principles, GTIPA members are committed to approaching globalization and trade through an innovation-based perspective. This perspective recognizes the immense potential of innovation in improving existing processes, products, services, and business models, and its role in expanding economies and promoting sustainable development. This report highlights the mounting economic costs of burdensome regulations that exact far more costs than benefits on societies—and which in many countries have led to unchecked regulatory accumulation—and the adverse impact on innovation, productivity, and long-term growth they cause. Across advanced and developing economies alike, layers of outdated, duplicative, and often conflicting regulations have accumulated over decades, with little systematic reevaluation. This regulatory burden is particularly harmful to startups and small firms, which face disproportionate compliance costs and reduced flexibility. Evidence shows that excessive regulation slows investment, distorts the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction, and incentivizes informality, especially in emerging markets where a significant portion of the labor force operates outside the formal economy. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in sectors such as textiles and construction informality can exceed over 60 percent of the world’s adult labor force, stunting sustainable growth. Meanwhile, studies find that streamlining regulation, particularly by liberalizing market entry, can unlock substantial economic gains. For instance, moving from median- to least-regulated among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries could boost employment growth by 1 percent annually. As such, effective reform efforts must go beyond rule-counting and focus instead on reducing compliance costs, fostering innovation, and ensuring that regulation supports rather than stifles dynamic economic activity. When it comes to regulation—just as for innovation—the choice isn’t between all government or no government, it’s about what’s the optimal level of government engagement in fostering sensible regulations that effectively enable innovation. To be sure, effective regulations are critically important to the success of countries’ advanced technology industries. For instance, if countries wish to lead in biopharmaceutical innovation, governments need to implement effective drug regulatory agencies to ensure that the drugs industry develops are indeed safe and efficacious. A good example of regulatory innovation comes from the United States. In the mid-1980s, it took on average three years for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to complete drug evaluations. In 1992, the United States introduced the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), which permitted the FDA to collect user fees from industry, helping ensure the agency could be adequately staffed with high-quality personnel and appropriate workflow and project-management frameworks to support making accurate and timely determinations regarding the safety and efficacy of new human drug applications for approval. [1] Today, the FDA makes drug safety and efficacy determinations in about 10 months, with no decrease in the accuracy of those determinations. Similarly, if countries want to manufacture innovative commercial airplanes or autonomous vehicles, regulatory systems need to validate the safety of these systems, while eschewing overly burdensome regulations. When it comes to regulation—just as for innovation—the choice isn’t between all government or no government, it’s about what’s the optimal level of government engagement in fostering sensible regulations that effectively enable innovation. This volume compiles vignettes from thirteen countries: Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, and the United States. A common pattern across countries has been the accumulation of regulatory layers over the past several decades, often without consistent reevaluation. In the United States, the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations alone exceeds 170,000 pages. This regulatory buildup often results in conflicting rules, reduced business agility, and increased compliance costs, especially for startups and small businesses. Most significantly, excessive regulation suppresses innovation and slows productivity and gross domestic product (GDP) growth across sectors. Regulatory agencies frequently lack the institutional mechanisms or political will to systematically review existing rules to determine which are outdated, duplicative, or counterproductive. As a result, the system tends to be reactive rather than adaptive. Another significant challenge to deregulation has been the accumulation of privileges and benefits these regulations have created over time. As laws and rules are promulgated, they often confer advantages, whether intentionally or not, on specific interest groups. These may include favorable tax treatments, trade protections, government subsidies, monopolistic or oligopolistic positions, elevated wages in protected sectors, or enhanced political influence. Once granted, these benefits become entrenched. Both private actors and segments of the public which benefit from the status quo are likely to resist any reform that threatens their position. This creates a powerful constituency for regulatory inertia. Attempts to roll back regulations are often framed as attacks on jobs, national interests, or fairness, even if the regulations in question distort markets, reduce efficiency, or limit innovation. As a result, deregulation becomes not just a technical task, but a deeply political one, entangled in negotiations over power, privilege, and distribution. Empirical evidence underscores the economic costs of overregulation. Several studies show that regulatory barriers, particularly barriers to market entry, are negatively associated with investment levels. Regulatory reforms that liberalize entry, on the other hand, are strongly correlated with increased investment and productivity. Anti-competitive product market regulations significantly reduce employment across OECD countries. [2] Additional research reveals that such regulations hinder multifactor productivity growth, while others identified a positive relationship of having a stronger protection of intellectual property rights, as they tend to be associated with higher research and development (R&D) intensity. [3] Research by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has found that in industries undergoing substantial regulatory reforms, deregulation led to long-term increases in investment. Notably, the most impactful aspect of reform was the liberalization of market entry, while industry-level privatization had relatively limited effects. The marginal benefits of deregulation were greatest when reforms were more comprehensive, and the initial level of regulation was high. [4] Macroeconomic models further suggest that sequencing reforms, starting with product market deregulation, can reduce opposition to labor market reforms by first diminishing the rents available in union-firm bargaining processes. However, such sequencing may be difficult in consensus-driven political systems where veto players limit reform momentum. [5] The World Bank has identified two main channels through which regulation can harm economic growth. First, regulation distorts the Schumpeterian process of creative destruction, limiting firm dynamics and innovation. Second, excessive regulation incentivizes firms to operate informally to avoid compliance costs. [6] Several studies show that regulatory barriers, particularly barriers to market entry, are negatively associated with investment levels. In many countries, especially in developing economies, firms respond to burdensome regulations by moving into the informal sector. In Argentina, for example, 42 percent of the workforce operates informally, with some sectors, like textiles and construction, seeing informality rates in excess of 70 percent. [7] These firms often stay suboptimally small, use informal supply chains, and divert resources to avoid detection or bribe officials. This results in slower, less sustainable economic growth. A broad body of research quantifies the economic benefits of reducing regulatory burdens. The IMF estimates that a country moving from the median to the least-regulated decile among OECD nations could gain roughly 1 percent in annual employment growth. Cumulative U.S. regulations between 1980 and 2012 reduced GDP growth by about one percentage point annually, mainly by distorting and discouraging business investment. [8] Other studies suggest that a 10-percentage-point increase in regulatory burden reduces per capita income growth by 0.5 percentage points annually. [9] Historical examples support these findings. Deregulation of the United Kingdom’s transport and communications sectors in the 1980s increased investment by roughly 3 percentage points. In the United States, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) estimated that final rules issued in 2016 imposed between $74 billion and $110 billion in annual costs (in 2014 dollars)—and that fewer than 0.5 percent of those rules met the threshold for detailed economic evaluation. [10] The regulatory review process itself is often constrained by cost. For example, OMB only evaluates rules expected to cost over $100 million annually, and even then, only if the issuing agency has already conducted an analysis. Federal regulatory agencies frequently propose rules without adequately considering their effects on innovation. This oversight stems from two persistent challenges: the political focus on short-term outcomes and a reluctance to challenge entrenched incumbents. ITIF’s Stephen Ezell and Robert Atkinson have suggested addressing this gap by establishing an Office of Innovation Review (OIR) within OMB. The OIR would serve as a dedicated advocate for innovation within the regulatory process. Its mandate would include evaluating whether agencies are promoting innovation or unnecessarily hindering it and recommending alternative regulatory approaches that better support technological progress. [11] Cumulative U.S. regulations between 1980 and 2012 reduced GDP growth by about one percentage point annually, mainly by distorting and discouraging business investment. Efforts to control new regulation, such as the United Kingdom’s “one-in, one-out” policy, have yielded mixed results. A Centre for Policy Studies assessment found that by 2012, up to 50 percent of new regulations fell outside the policy’s scope. The United Kingdom’s National Audit Office estimates that while $1.1 billion in costs were eliminated since 2015, $10.4 billion in new compliance costs were imposed on businesses outside the scope of the policy. [12] Ultimately, what matters is not the number of regulations, but their net economic cost and their impact on innovation. Effective deregulation focuses on reducing compliance costs and encouraging innovation, not just eliminating rules. Despite considerable variation in political context and policy instruments, the country case studies compiled in this report reveal several common themes in the design and implementation of deregulation approaches. These shared patterns underscore the global relevance of regulatory streamlining as a tool to spur innovation, increase competition, and unlock productivity growth. This volume highlights the innovation-inducing impacts of sensible deregulation across multiple sectors of nations’ economies from telecommunications to finance, energy, transportation, agriculture, and other professional sectors. Several of the case studies highlighted how deregulation is empowering innovations in agriculture. ▪ Both Australia and India have reformed drone regulations to facilitate their use of smart agriculture (i.e., precision farming) applications. Australia also streamlined procedures for approvals for Internet of Things devices in remote areas (e.g., soil moisture sensors, livestock trackers). ▪ To advance its food security agenda, Indonesia deregulated fertilizer subsidies and created an electronic registration system for them, streamlining the submission process and reducing regulatory bottlenecks. ▪ In 2025, Pakistan’s Prime Minister explicitly called for a “comprehensive regulatory framework to support innovation and transparency” in agriculture and introduced numerous reforms thereof. Effective and well-functioning energy markets are indispensable for accelerating innovation and expanding economic opportunity. Clean energy technologies—from advanced batteries and hydrogen systems to carbon capture and next-generation nuclear—stand to capture significant shares of rapidly growing global markets, generating jobs and strengthening industrial competitiveness in the process. At the same time, oil and gas will remain integral to the global energy mix for decades, making it critical that markets incentivize the responsible and efficient use of these resources. In energy markets, deregulation often pursues dual goals of competitiveness and sustainability. Examples: ▪ Argentina liberalized its oil and gas sector while promoting renewables. ▪ Australia and Brazil leveraged deregulation to attract private investment into renewables, particularly in mining-intensive regions where hybrid energy systems reduce diesel dependency. ▪ Bulgaria completed a wholesale shift to market-based electricity pricing, integrated into the European Union (EU) energy grid. ▪ Poland introduced market-based electricity pricing and supported the development of renewable energy auctions to attract private capital, while also investing in energy storage and smart grid technologies to modernize its power infrastructure. ▪ In the United States, energy deregulation varies by state but often focuses on increasing competition in generation and retail electricity markets, reducing consumer costs, and enabling innovation through demand-side management and integration of distributed energy resources. Financial innovations, enabled by advances in digital technologies and modernized regulatory approaches, can expand financial inclusion, enhance productivity in the financial sector, and boost economic growth. Flexible and adaptive regulation is critical to unlocking these benefits, allowing new services such as mobile payments, peer-to-peer lending, and blockchain applications to reach more consumers and businesses. By reducing outdated regulatory barriers and fostering a more innovation-friendly environment, policymakers can help ensure that capital flows more efficiently, underserved communities gain access to financial tools, and the financial system becomes more competitive and dynamic, ultimately driving broader economic prosperity. Examples: ▪ Argentina’s and Brazil’s fintech sector flourished thanks to light-touch regulation and interoperability. These countries also have a higher adoption rate for blockchain technology. ▪ Australia implemented a Consumer Data Rights framework and regulatory sandboxes to foster open banking and reduce barriers to entry. ▪ Bangladesh achieved rapid financial inclusion by authorizing telecom-linked mobile banking services such as bKash. These reforms helped broaden access to credit, especially in underserved rural areas. Expanding and modernizing telecommunications and digital infrastructure is essential for driving sustained economic growth, strengthening competitiveness, and ensuring that everyone can participate fully in the global digital economy. Putting digital at the center of infrastructure strategy creates jobs in the near term while delivering superior long-term benefits compared to traditional investments, boosting national security, enhancing resilience in the face of disasters, and reducing environmental impacts through smarter, more-efficient systems. High-capacity broadband networks, upgraded communications systems, and intelligent infrastructure form the backbone of innovation across sectors, enabling advanced manufacturing, telehealth, e-commerce, and digital government services. Examples: ▪ In Argentina and Brazil, the dismantling of state monopolies in telecoms catalyzed major expansions in service quality and access. ▪ Bangladesh saw a parallel surge in mobile connectivity and e-commerce following market opening. ▪ Colombia has introduced landmark reforms implementing a regulatory framework for open finance, becoming one of the first countries in Latin America to do so. ▪ Germany promoted online pharmacy competition by removing restrictions on mail-order medicine sales. ▪ Italy focused on procedural simplifications to accelerate broadband deployment. ▪ Pakistan’s reforms enabled rapid growth in mobile and broadband penetration through spectrum liberalization, competition-friendly licensing, and infrastructure-sharing policies. ▪ In August 2025, the Philippines enacted the Open Access in Data Transmission law, reducing barriers to entry and expansion in Internet service provision, helping to open the Philippines market, boost competition, lower network rollout costs, and improve digital service quality. The entry of new operators and increased investment in mobile broadband helped expand access across urban and rural areas alike, positioning the telecom sector as a key enabler of digital inclusion and economic modernization. Technological and market innovation in transportation often falters under the weight of outdated regulatory frameworks designed to shield incumbents from competition. Excessive or misaligned regulation can stifle productivity-enhancing change by focusing on preserving the status quo rather than achieving broader societal outcomes such as safety, efficiency, and consumer welfare. To unlock these benefits, policymakers should pursue targeted, intelligent regulatory reforms that maintain public safety while reducing uncertainty. In sectors such as railroads, trucking, and commercial drones, regulators are grappling with rapid advances in automation that could deliver significant safety and efficiency gains for society. Examples: ▪ Argentina liberalized its aviation sector, allowing low-cost carriers to enter, expanding connectivity, and reducing fares. ▪ Germany’s opening of long-distance bus and freight markets led to rapid efficiency gains. ▪ In Korea, the ride-hailing service Tada became a prominent mobility innovation case, showcasing how regulatory sandboxes enabled new business models while also revealing the pushback from entrenched taxi industry interests that ultimately led to tighter restrictions. Both the German and Argentinean cases exhibit a similar pattern: elevated prices were imposed as a means of protecting a specific industry, rail transport in the case of Germany and bus transport in the case of Argentina. The deregulation policies shared a core objective: removing anti-competitive barriers to entry that had protected incumbents and constrained consumer choice. Several countries deployed deregulation as a means to improve the overall business environment. ITIF’s “Innovation Success Triangle” envisions economic vitality as depending on the interplay of three core pillars: supportive business, regulatory, and innovation/tech policy environments. [13] A business climate that fosters high-quality management, widespread adoption of information technologies, and access to capital; a regulatory, trade, and tax framework that ensures open markets, transparent rules, and effective intellectual property protections; and an innovation/tech policy ecosystem that invests in R&D, nurtures talent through STEM education and high-skill immigration, and catalyzes collaboration between industry, academia, and government. The following are some of the case studies with a particular focus on reducing bureaucratic friction and enabling entrepreneurship. Examples: ▪ In Chile, the “Your Business in a Day” program streamlined company registration by digitizing and consolidating multiple procedures, cutting the average time to start a business from nearly a month to under a week. This reform significantly increased formal firm creation, especially among micro and small enterprises. ▪ Costa Rica has introduced the concept of the “Revolutionary Sandbox”—an alternative to the traditional regulatory sandbox—that empowers innovative Costa Rican companies developing business model that comply with four key objectives: 1) a world class product or service; 2) a disruptive innovation; 3) scalable; and 4) the solution will be offered in the global market. ▪ Ecuador has recognized that data localization policies create barriers to service innovation, especially in the fintech sectors, and has taken steps to repeal these policies. ▪ India recently introduced significant regulatory reforms that unlocked private-sector innovation in the country’s space and drone sectors. ▪ In Italy, a series of “Simplification Decrees” reduced red tape for permits and infrastructure projects, introduced digital-by-default authorization systems, and established a fast-track regime for strategic investments for fixed and mobile networks. These measures enhanced legal certainty and reduced compliance burdens, attracting greater levels of private capital. ▪ Pakistan also undertook initiatives to improve its business climate by digitizing registration services, streamlining tax procedures, and liberalizing investment rules in key sectors. These reforms contributed to its advancement in global ease-of-doing-business rankings. ▪ In Poland, pro-business regulatory reforms included initiatives to enable legally valid electronic services of documents for administrative and judicial procedures. Collectively, these examples illustrate how deregulation—when oriented toward operational efficiency and legal clarity—can lower barriers to entry, promote formalization, and foster a more dynamic private sector. Moreover, these case studies illustrate that while reform strategies must be tailored to national contexts, their underlying logic—reducing compliance costs, enhancing market contestability, and accelerating innovation—is widely shared. The diverse successes documented in this volume affirm that well-designed deregulation, grounded in transparency and competitive neutrality, remains a powerful lever for inclusive economic growth. ▪ Download the PDF . ▪ Visit GTIPA’s website .

Cancer remains a global scourge, the second-leading cause of death among Americans, killing over 600,000 annually. About 40 percent of Americans will develop cancer in their lifetimes. Age is the leading risk factor for cancer; therefore, it’s not surprising the disease hits America’s older citizens particularly hard. Americans over 65 account for 60 percent of newly diagnosed malignancies and 70 percent of all cancer deaths. 1,200 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed every day with late-stage cancer. That’s 50 Medicare beneficiaries an hour. Unfortunately, despite some progress, too many cancers are still found late — when outcomes are worse and costs are highest. That’s in part because it’s remained extremely difficult to effectively preventively screen for cancer at the population scale. In fact, only five types of cancer—breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, and “high-risk” lung—currently have guideline-recommended screening options available. The vast majority of cancers—including blood, head and neck, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers, among others—have no guideline-recommended screening tests available. In fact, 70 percent of all U.S. cancer fatalities come from cancers for which there are currently no proven screening tests. This explains why so many cancers are unfortunately detected only when patients arrive at doctors’ offices manifesting physical symptoms; as only 20 percent of U.S. cancer cases are screen-detected. It’s thus time for the United States (and the world) to embrace a revolutionary new approach to cancer detection, akin to major technological advancements that have resulted in vast improvements for Americans’ health and economic well being. Enter multi-cancer early detection (MCED) screening tests, which, from a simple blood draw, can detect as many as 50 different kinds of cancer with a low false positive rate and connect the cancer to the tissue of origin in the body. MCED tests use modern technologies including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and genomic sequencing to identify circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed by cancer cells in the body. MCED tests herald the ability to test for many cancers simultaneously and also to detect cancers at early stages of progression in the body. Detecting cancers earlier could produce tremendous individual health, public health, and economic benefits. Catching cancers earlier can give patients a four times greater chance of survival. Indeed, when cancer is diagnosed after it has spread, the five-year cancer-specific survival rate is 21 percent, compared with 89 percent when the cancer is diagnosed early and still localized. Likewise, cancers are far more economical to treat at earlier than later stages of disease progression. I n the Medicare population, average total annual costs of care are up to seven times higher for Medicare beneficiaries who are diagnosed at later stages rather than earlier stages. In short, MCED technologies can detect more cancer earlier, saving lives and saving costs. The United States has led in the development of MCED screening tests, but competitors are emerging worldwide. In particular, China is prioritizing the development of MCEDs as part of its national priority to dramatically expand its global biotech leadership. If America is going to continue to lead in this field amidst growing global competition, enabling both its innovative companies to thrive and its citizens to enjoy the benefits of these technologies, policymakers will need to craft a supportive regulatory and coverage environment. If we don’t, other countries will, and they may eventually come to dominate the largest longitudinal public health application of genomic sequencing. Congress has a long history of acting to create Medicare coverage for cancer screening, most recently when the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 added prostate and colorectal cancer screening benefits to Medicare coverage. To help make it possible for older Americans to take advantage of the enormous potential of MCED technologies, it’s time for Congress to act again. Congress should pass the bipartisan “Nancy Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act,” which would create the authority for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to use an evidence-based process to cover blood-based MCED tests and future test methods once approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while maintaining CMS’s authority to use an evidence-based process to determine coverage parameters for these new types of tests. The legislation affirms that multi-cancer detection tests are designed to complement, not replace, existing screening cancer screening methods. The bipartisan legislation enjoys the sponsorship of 295 members of the House of Representatives and 62 Senators as of this hearing date. In summary, MCED technologies are poised to radically transform America’s cancer-screening paradigm for the significant benefit of Americans’ individual and public health. Congress can play a critical role in making that transformation happen. Cancer remains one of humanity’s most implacable enemies, with over 22 million cases diagnosed globally in 2022 and 35 million cases expected annually across the world by 2035. [1] Cancer is responsible for almost one in six deaths globally. [2] In the United States, cancer claims over 600,000 lives annually (an estimated 612,000 in 2024), making it the second-most common cause of death, and which is expected to become the leading cause by 2030. [3] Over 1,600 Americans perish each day as a result of cancer. [4] Approximately one in four Americans (40 out of 100 men and 39 out of 100 women) will develop cancer during their lifetimes. [5] Cancer hits America’s older citizens particularly hard. Age is the leading risk factor for developing cancer. The median age for a cancer diagnosis is age 66. [6] Eighty-eight percent of individuals diagnosed with cancer in the United States are age 50 or older, while 57 percent are age 65 or over. [7] Citizens over 65 account for 70 percent of all cancer deaths. Over 1,200 Medicare beneficiaries are diagnosed every day with late-stage cancer (that’s 50 an hour). Approximately 1 million Medicare beneficiaries were diagnosed with cancer in 2024. [8] Fortunately, American cancer fatality rates have decreased somewhat over the past half-century, largely the result of a combination of more-effective screening approaches, an overall decrease in smoking in the population, and more-effective treatment and therapeutic options. For some of the most common cancers—lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate—reductions in smoking and improvements in screening have led to 36 percent fewer deaths than would have occurred otherwise. [9] Americans’ deaths from cancer have fallen from 193.9 per 100,000 population in 1950 to 152.5 by 2017. [10] Since peaking in the early 1990s (at 215 per 100,000 population), U.S. cancer death rates have declined by 27 percent. [11] This decline translated into more than 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths from 1991 to 2017. [12] And breakthrough therapies such as Avastin and Herceptin for breast cancer, Keytruda for lung cancer, and Yervoy for melanoma help explain why American citizens enjoy the highest cancer survival rates in the world. For instance, over 99 percent of U.S. women suffering from localized breast cancer are still living five years later. [13] One study estimates that approximately 73 percent of survival gains in cancer are attributable to new treatments, including medicines. [14] Moreover, as Lichtenberg explains, “During the period 2000–2011, the premature (before age 75) cancer mortality rate … declined by about 9 percent.… In the absence of pharmaceutical innovation during the period 1985–1996, the premature cancer mortality rate would have increased about 12 percent during the period 2000–2011.” [15] Yet progress, while real, has been slow. As Azra Raza, a professor of medicine and director of the MDS Center at Columbia University, writes, “Cancer is still beating us … I have been studying and treating cancer for 35 years, and here’s what I know about the progress made in that time: There has been far less than it appears.” [16] She points out that, for all the progress, overall cancer death rates are not dramatically different from what they were in the 1930s, before they began increasing alongside the rise in smoking. Indeed, while the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 U.S. population from heart disease fell by roughly two-thirds from 1950 to 2010, the similar rate for cancer just barely decreased. (See Figure 1.) As Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University, explains, part of this disparity can be attributed to the fact that the heart disease research community has largely focused on early detection and prevention, “whereas the oncology community has been more focused on curing advanced disease.” [17] Or, as Raza puts it, “We now invest a lot of effort into finding minimal residual disease. Why not apply the same rigor and focus to finding minimal initial disease?” [18] Figure 1: Age-adjusted rate of death per 100,000 population [19] Thus, despite some progress, cancer still afflicts millions annually and imposes tremendous costs on the U.S. health care system, as well as the broader economy. Cancer is the second-most-costly disease in the United States. [20] National cancer costs were estimated to be $208.9 billion in 2020. [21] By 2030, America’s cancer care costs are expected to rise to $246 billion (a 34 percent increase from the year 2015). [22] Globally, the economic cost of cancer care is expected to total $5.3 trillion between 2020 and 2050 (and that’s just for 29 cancers). [23] A 2008 study estimated that the economic value of life lost from all cancer deaths in the year 2000 totaled $960.6 billion and predicted that the total value of life lost in 2020 from cancer deaths in the United States would reach $1.5 trillion. [24] The tremendous costs cancer imposes conversely suggest tremendous benefits if cancers could be detected earlier when treatments are more likely to succeed and as more-effective treatments and therapeutics for cancer are invented. In fact, one study finds that cancer screenings have already saved the United States at least $6.5 trillion. [25] Further, Murphy and Topel, considering the benefits of increased longevity and improved quality of life, find that a 1 percent reduction in mortality from cancer could deliver roughly $500 billion in net present benefits, while a cure (if one could be achieved) could deliver $50 trillion in present and future benefits. [26] The number one risk factor for cancer is age. And, today, over one-third of U.S. cancer costs are attributed to the Medicare population. [27] Meanwhile, analysts estimate that Medicare will spend $1 trillion on cancer over the next decade. [28] Further, in the Medicare population, average total annual costs of care are up to seven times higher for Medicare beneficiaries who are diagnosed in later stages as opposed to earlier stages of the disease. [29] Cancer will not be beaten without hard-fought biomedical innovation, both in the development of technologies to screen for cancers and therapeutics to treat them. However, only five types of cancer—breast, cervical, colorectal, prostate, and “high-risk” lung (collectively accounting for about 40 percent of U.S. cancer incidence)—currently have guideline-recommended screening options available today. This means that the vast majority of cancers—including blood, head and neck, pancreatic, ovarian, and liver cancers—have no guideline-recommended screening tests available. [30] Seventy percent of U.S. cancer deaths occur from cancers for which there are no guideline-recommended screening alternatives. [31] As such, the vast majority of cancers are unfortunately found only when patients arrive at doctors’ offices manifesting physical symptoms. Only 14 percent of cancers are found through the guideline-approved screenings for the five types of aforementioned cancers. [32] Fortunately, a revolutionary new approach called multi-cancer early detection (MCED)—powered by a suite of advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and gene sequencing—is emerging, heralding the opportunity to transform cancer screening, potentially detecting many more cancers much earlier, saving lives and potentially generating significant economic benefits. MCED technologies hold the potential to detect, from a simple blood draw, as many as 50 different types of cancers with a very high rate of accuracy, a low false positive rate, and the ability to trace the detected cancer to its likely tissue of origin with a high degree of confidence. As all human cells shed nucleic acid fragments into the bloodstream, the technology works by detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the bloodstream as a biomarker for cancer detection. Further, the technology can link detected cancers to their tissue of origin by analyzing methylation patterns. Methylation refers to an essential step in the process of cellular differentiation—what directs a cell to evolve into kidney, liver, or heart tissue, for instance. With each cell type in the body having a unique methylation pattern, or “fingerprint,” MCED uses a combination of novel biochemistry and AI techniques to learn to connect detected cancers to their likely tissue of origin. MCED tests can simultaneously screen for signals of dozens of cancers—the vast preponderance of which currently enjoy no effective screening technique—with a potentially high degree of accuracy, opening a new frontier of cancer screening possibility. As Dr. Chetan Bettegowda of Johns Hopkins University explains, MCED introduces the potential “to transform the concept of cancer screening from an organ-by-organ, site-by-site, to a whole system, patient, individual approach.” [33] It also introduces the possibility to screen for cancers in the asymptomatic population. This matters greatly, for, as Dr. Norman “Ned” Sharpless, former director of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health, notes, “The most common way people are diagnosed with a cancer is when they present to a doctor with a new symptom [subsequently identified as cancer].” [34] Of these, the vast majority are discovered at the latest stage, stage IV. In fact, out of every 100,000 cancers diagnosed in clinical settings, stage IV cancers account for approximately 170, compared with 100 for stage III, 75 for stage II, and 50 for stage I. [35] Earlier cancer detection generates significant health and economic benefits, as the following sections explain. Cancer is most effectively and efficiently treated when it is caught early, when it is localized, and before it has metastasized to distant parts of the body. As one report explains, “Survival rates improve dramatically when cancer is diagnosed early and the disease is confined to the organ of origin before it has had a chance to spread, and the cancer is more likely to be treated successfully.” [36] Early detection, especially resulting from effective cancer screening protocols, is paramount to reducing mortality from cancer. As the American Cancer Society explains, “Screening is known to reduce mortality for cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, lung (among current or former heavy smokers), and probably prostate.” [37] On average, catching cancer earlier gives patients a four times greater chance of survival. [38] For instance, one study found that when cancer is diagnosed after it has spread, the five-year cancer-specific survival rate is 21 percent, compared with 89 percent when the cancer is diagnosed early and still localized. [39] According to a study by Clarke et al., “Projected Reductions in Absolute Cancer–Related Deaths from Diagnosing Cancers Before Metastasis, 2006–2015,” detecting cancers with distant metastases at earlier stages could potentially reduce cancer-related five-year mortality by at least 15 to 24 percent. [40] The study found that detection of multiple cancer types earlier than stage IV could reduce at least 15 percent of cancer-related deaths within five years, affecting not only cancer-specific but all-cause mortality. Stage IV cancers represented 18 percent of all estimated diagnoses but 48 percent of all estimated cancer-related deaths within five years. Assuming all stage IV cancers were diagnosed at stage III, 51 fewer cancer-related deaths would be expected per 100,000, a reduction of 15 percent of all cancer-related deaths. Assuming one-third of metastatic cancers were diagnosed at stage III, one-third diagnosed at stage II, and one-third diagnosed at stage I, 81 fewer cancer-related deaths would be expected per 100,000, a reduction of 24 percent of all cancer-related deaths. [41] The importance of early detection becomes even clearer when examining its impact on survival rates for certain forms of cancer. Well more than 90 percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer at the earliest stage survive their disease for at least five years, compared with about 15 percent for women diagnosed with the most-advanced stage of disease. More than 80 percent of lung cancer patients will survive for at least one year if diagnosed at the earliest stage, compared with around 15 percent for those diagnosed with the most-advanced stages of the disease. Unfortunately, only about 15 percent of lung cancers are diagnosed at the localized stage, when clinical intervention can markedly improve patient outcomes. [42] Ninety percent of women diagnosed with earliest-stage ovarian cancer survive their disease for at least five years, compared with around 5 percent for women diagnosed with the most-advanced stage of disease. And more than nine in ten bowel cancer patients will survive the disease for more than five years if diagnosed at the earliest stage. [43] Earlier detection makes all forms of cancer intervention more effective than when cancers are diagnosed at later stages. As Dr. Vogelstein notes, patients with stage III colorectal cancer, if they have micro metastases (i.e., a very small micro-metastatic disease, even if already spread to other organs), given chemotherapy, can recover almost 50 percent of the time; whereas if the cancer becomes visible and bulky (visible metastases), the recovery rate is close to nil. This also holds true for the newest, most cutting-edge interventions, such as targeted immunotherapies (i.e., immune checkpoint inhibitors) and CAR-T-based (chimeric-antigen receptor T cell) therapies: Recovery rates are far higher in patients with low tumor burdens than with high. [44] Indeed, in quite many cases, these technologies mean that patients with localized (i.e., Stage I-II) solid tumors are potentially curable. As Raza writes (about what this evidence makes clear): What we need now is a paradigm shift. Today, the newest methods generating the most research and expense tend to be focused on treating the worst cases—chasing after the last cancer cells in end-stage patients whose prognoses are the worst. We need instead to commit to anticipating, finding, and destroying the first cancer cells. [45] Indeed, effective screening can deliver tremendous benefits: Since the pap smear test was introduced, the cervical cancer death rate in the United States has declined by about 70 percent. [46] The first U.S. trial of breast-cancer screening, launched in 1963, reduced mortality by 25 percent in its first 18 years. [47] And analysts estimate that, since 1998, the number of U.S. breast cancer deaths prevented due to mammography increased from 384,000 to 614,000. [48] According to a 2016 study by Seabury et al., “Quantifying the Gains in the War on Cancer Due to Improved Treatment and Earlier Detection,” an examination of the 15 most-common types of cancers found that the three-year cancer-related mortality of cancer patients fell by 16.7 percent from 1997 to 2007, with advances in early detection responsible for 4.5 percentage points of that decline (in other words, 27 percent of the decline) and advancements in treatment for a reduction of 12.2 percentage points. [49] As the authors wrote, “Cancer detection has seen significant breakthroughs, such as digital mammograms and the development of genetic profile tests.” [50] Their study found that the relative importance of treatment and detection in reducing mortality varied across cancer types. Improvements in detection contributed to reduced mortality rates for all 15 types of cancers studied, but were most significant for thyroid, prostate, and kidney cancer. [51] Improved early detection accounted for 60 percent of the reduction in the three-year mortality rate for prostate cancer and just about half the reduction for kidney and renal pelvis cancers. [52] Earlier detection of colorectal cancer accounted for 42 percent of the gain in colorectal cancer survival rates from 1997 to 2007, abetted by the fact that the percentage of adults receiving recommended screening for colorectal cancer rose from 44 to 65 percent from 2000 to 2010. (That figure stood at 68.8 percent as of 2018.) [53] Overall, the study estimates that the benefits of earlier detection (for this suite of 15 cancers) during the years 1997 to 2007 generated $19 billion in societal value (even without considering the benefits of having identified patients before they developed malignancies). [54] Earlier and better screening yields economic benefits as well. As noted, cancer screenings have already saved the United States at least $6.5 trillion. [55] Cancer is also much more economical to treat when caught at an earlier as opposed to a later stage. For instance, as noted, in the Medicare population, average total annual costs of care are up to seven times higher for Medicare beneficiaries who are diagnosed in later stages rather than earlier stages. The 2018 report “Medical Care Costs Associated With Cancer in Integrated Delivery Systems” examined the costs associated with treating cancer from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2008 in a population of over 45,000 patients diagnosed with one of the four most-commonly diagnosed cancers in the United States (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate) who were members of one of the four health care plans within the Cancer Research Network. The report shows significant potential economic savings from earlier cancer detection, and that mean total one-year costs for lung cancer ranged from $50,700 (stage I) to $97,400 (stage IV) among patients ages <65 years and from $44,000 (stage I) to $71,200 (stage IV) among patients ages ≥65 years. For colorectal cancer patients under age 65, the five-year cost of treatment for a patient with stage IV cancer was $205,100, compared with $65,000 for a stage I patient. (For individuals over 65 diagnosed with colorectal cancer, the five-year total costs ranged from $67,900 for a stage I patient to $141,000 for stage II patients). Similar trends were apparent for lung and prostate cancer, with the five-year total costs for a stage I lung cancer patient under the age of 65 estimated at $93,800 and for a stage IV patient at $200,300; for prostate cancer, five-year total costs for the under-65 stage I prostate patient stood at $51,800 compared with $72,300 for a stage IV patient. [56] Overall, the report observes “higher costs among patients diagnosed with advanced versus earlier-stage disease in the fee-for-service setting.” It concludes by noting that “net costs of care were highest for patients aged <65 years with advanced-stage cancers, suggesting that early detection and prevention strategies are key to curtailing high long-term costs associated with late-stage disease.” The report “emphasizes the need for continued effective cancer screening” especially “to reduce the number of invasive colorectal and late-stage female breast cancer diagnoses.” [57] The study’s message is clear: Earlier detection of cancers saves both lives and costs for health care systems and economies more broadly. Similarly, a 2017 study, “Estimating Cost Savings for Early Cancer Diagnosis,” sought to examine the cost savings from early cancer diagnosis for 19 cancers, assuming that all stage III and IV cases were detected at stage I or II instead (using current incidence rates for these cancers). As the report notes, “In many cases, it is much less costly to treat cancer when it is diagnosed earlier.” [58] In part, that’s because cancer patients’ costs of care in the last year of life are sizably higher than during early stages. The study concluded that earlier diagnosis of those cancers could generate $26 billion in cost savings annually, equivalent to 17 percent of total estimated yearly expenditures on cancer treatment. [59] For breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers, and melanoma, which are the top-five cancers in the United States by incidence, with an estimated 859,110 new cases in 2017 (accounting for 50.9 percent of the 1,688,780 cancer cases diagnosed that year), the study estimated $10.7 billion in savings from earlier diagnosis (about 41.5 percent of cost savings from all cancers). [60] Those findings also concord with a 2016 study which examined the cost of breast cancer coverage across various stages of the disease. The study concluded that “the costs were higher for patients whose cancer was more advanced at diagnosis, for all cumulative 6-month periods (months 0–6, 0–12, 0–18, and 0–24).” It found that the average costs per patient (as allowed by insurance companies) in the year after diagnosis were $60,637, $82,121, $129,387, and $134,682 for disease stage 0, I/II, III, and IV, respectively, and the costs allowed per patient in the 24 months after the index diagnosis were $71,909, $97,066, $159,442, and $182,655, for those four stages. As the study concluded, “The cost difference based on the stage at diagnosis was largely driven by the cost of chemotherapy and noncancer treatments.” [61] Across the broader U.S. health care system, treatment of metastatic cancer may be as much as two times more costly than treatment of cancer before it metastasizes. [62] In terms of cancer screening and detection, MCED approaches are poised to yield several additional unique benefits, beyond the ability to screen for many more cancers and detect them earlier. First, the simple reality is that it would be logistically, economically, and feasibly impossible to screen individually for up to 50 different cancers. Not only would it be extremely time consuming and expensive to ask patients to take so many individual tests, it would be extremely difficult to logistically administer so many tests. There could also be an accumulation of false positive returns. It’s far more efficient to test for dozens of cancers simultaneously. Second, the screening process (beyond the blood draw) is much less invasive and, with many cancers presenting as unspecified pains in certain parts of the body, which can even be difficult to physically biopsy, MCED can expand the range of cancers for which earlier detection is physiologically possible. Third, the logistical ease of MCED testing (from a blood draw) could benefit those living in rural communities who may experience more difficulty in seeing doctors for physical screening exams or more difficulty in accessing specialized screening services. This could have a particularly important impact in ameliorating racial and socioeconomic disparities in cancer screening availability. This matters, especially when cancer deaths in America’s rural areas are 14 percent higher than in urban areas (with that disparity increasing over time). Moreover, the five-year cancer survival rate (for all cancers) in America’s rural areas is 8 percent lower than in urban areas. [63] In part due to America’s urban/rural divide, the extent of cancer screening also varies considerably by state. For instance, the percentage of adults ages 50 to 75 who reported being up to date with colorectal cancer screening in 2016 ranged from 75.3 percent in Massachusetts to 59.9 percent in Mississippi. [64] Likewise, the percentage of female Medicare enrollees ages 65 to 74 that received an annual mammography screening in 2017 was 39 percent in Mississippi, compared with 54 percent in Massachusetts. [65] To be sure, there’s a clear distinction between differences in the medical availability of cancer screenings across states and differences in patients’ partaking of those screenings across states. However, as Otis Brawley, Bloomberg distinguished professor of Oncology and Epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, has noted, many of the disparities in the differences among states in death rates from cancer pertain to socioeconomic factors, such as access to transportation, access to doctors and medical facilities, and affordability of care. In fact, he notes that for women diagnosed with breast cancer, the fatality rate is half in Massachusetts what it is in Mississippi. [66] A fourth area where MCED approaches could deliver unique patient benefits pertains to equity, in terms of cancer screenings and, potentially, end results. Again, making it logistically and economically feasible to screen for a far greater number of cancers could generate significant equity benefits. That matters especially when Black, American Indian, and Native American individuals face disproportionately higher incidences of cancer fatalities. [67] Black men have the highest overall cancer death rate, which is 19 percent higher than that of White men in the United States. [68] As of 2020, African Americans still have the highest mortality rates of any racial or ethnic group for most cancers. And, while Hispanic men and women are less likely to be diagnosed with cancer than non-Hispanic whites overall, cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanic Americans. [69] Certainly there exist a wide range of factors that inform and cause racial, geographic, and socioeconomic disparities in cancer screening rates and in U.S. cancer fatalities. However, differences in access to cancer screening do appear to be one significant causal factor. Lastly, another benefit of MCED screening tests is that they may be able to help identify patient populations at earlier stages of disease progression, which can provide a platform for companies to innovate therapeutics against. One reason it has been difficult to develop treatments for certain cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, is that they are very difficult to diagnose at an early stage, and as such it’s difficult to identify patient populations against which clinical trials for possible therapeutics can be run. If MCED tests were deployed more widely across the population, and prove to deliver on their potential to identify cancers emerging at earlier stages, they could contribute to the identification of populations in which clinical trials of innovative therapeutics could occur. To be sure, the developers of MCED tests are focused on screening and diagnostics and are not making claims that their technologies can predict disease onset or identify biomarkers. But nevertheless, the point stands that a greater base of knowledge about patient populations with certain cancers at certain stages can provide a further platform on which innovation can occur to address some of these diseases, especially ones for which there are currently no effective treatments. In this regard, patients individually, and society broadly, need more data, not less, about the prevalence of cancer. While there exist potentially significant benefits from MCED screening, some concerns have been raised, including that they might lead to overdiagnosis or return very high false positive rates. The first concern pertains to MCED’s potential to detect “indolent” cancers, which are those that progress slowly and do not pose an imminent threat to a patient’s health. Some have called these the types or stages of cancers that people will increasingly die “with,” rather than “from.” As such it’s important that MCED technologies be attuned (or optimized) to identifying particularly the invasive, fastest-growing, most-lethal cancers. In this regard, it’s fortuitous that scientific research appears to indicate that indolent, less-aggressive cancers are less likely to shed ctDNA into the bloodstream and that it tends to be the more-aggressive, faster-growing cancers that are shedding the most ctDNA, conferring better ability for MCED tests to discriminate between indolent and aggressive cancers. [70] Closely related to the challenge of minimizing overdiagnosis is minimizing the return of false positives. While this will certainly be navigated in MCED screening, the reality is that it’s a challenge with the current single cancer-screening paradigm already, a challenge which we accept considering the vast benefits of current standard-of-care screening. The $27 billion America spends on cancer screening yields about 9 million positive results annually; of these, only 204,000 turn out to be actual cancers, while 8.8 million being false positives. [71] Likewise, the cumulative screening tests recommended for a 60-year-old U.S. female with a history of smoking (thus suggesting screening for breast, colon, cervical, and lung cancers) yield a 37 percent likelihood of at least one false positive result. [72] Critical here are cancer screening tests’ positive predictive value (PPV), which represents the probability that a patient with a positive (abnormal) test result actually has the disease. Here, given a very low comparative false-positive rate, MCED tests are significantly higher than single-cancer screening tests in terms of their PPV. To be sure, optimizing MCED systems to avoid “overdiagnosis,” increase their PPVs, and lower false positives will be crucially important to the overall success of MCED screening tests as they seek to complement the current standard of care. However, it is important to note that the bigger problem today is underdiagnosis, and the potential to make quite significant progress in that area should not be sacrificed out of fears of overdiagnosis, which the scientific evidence to date suggests can be mitigated by MCED technologies, especially as they continually learn and evolve over time, which is likely to further improve their accuracy. This is a result of intentional test design, and represents the difference in screening strategies regarding how a multi-cancer test can complement standard-of-care single-cancer screening tests. The global competition for leadership in the field of blood-based multi-cancer early detection has become increasingly fierce. No government has embraced MCED more than China. [73] China’s government views the technology both as a growth industry and the answer to China’s own burgeoning cancer burden (where the country encounters 4.8 million new cancer cases and 2.57 million cancer deaths annually). [74] Indeed, a number of innovative, highly competitive Chinese MCED players have emerged, including BurningRock Dx, SeekIn, Berry Oncology, Singlera Genomics, and GeneSeeq. China’s MCED competitors have leveraged the country’s strengths in genome sequencing—the country now being the world’s leader in genome sequencing capacity—which has given Chinese companies the ability to become increasingly viable players in the field of precision diagnostics and development of accurate, cost-effective, DNA-related diagnostic tests. [75] Moreover, China’s national biotech strategy affords MCED developers access to low-cost state capital, academic biobanks, and other resources. China has also promised to add several precision drugs and molecular-diagnosis products to its national medical-insurance list, ensuring that companies’ research costs will be recouped if they lead to a product. [76] China is doing so because it understands that committing the government as a procurer of such early detection technologies will help build companies and markets. China’s push toward MCED leadership fits as a part of China’s overall effort to become a much more significant player in the global biopharmaceutical industry, and in the oncology sector in particular. [77] Indeed, China’s share of global drugs under development has increased from just 1 percent in 2005 to 12 percent in 2020, while its share of all oncology drugs under development spiked from just 2 percent to 18 percent over that timeframe. China has risen to the second place in the world in terms of new drug development, with domestic drugs under research accounting for over one-fifth of the global total. [78] Meanwhile, China’s share of value added in the global biopharmaceutical industry jumped four-fold from 2002 to 2019, from a meager 5.6 to robust 24 percent. [79] Other countries are also looking to ensure their citizens receive the benefits of these technologies first. For instance, in November 2020, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service partnered with GRAIL to test its MCED technology, Galleri, in a program involving 165,000 British citizens, which may be expanded to one million British citizens. If the promise of MCED is to be realized in the United States, policymakers will need to get the regulatory and coverage environment right. As medical science’s understanding of cancer has evolved over the past half century, so too has the evolution of recommended cancer screening guidelines. As noted, individuals over 65 account for 60 percent of newly diagnosed malignancies and 70 percent of all cancer deaths in the United States. [80] That makes cancer screening an especially important issue for Americans on Medicare—and that’s why it’s important that Medicare carefully review potentially offering MCED screening as a covered benefit. Launched in 1966, Medicare is a program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that helps pay for health care services for citizens over the age of 65, certain younger people with disabilities or chronic diseases, and individuals with end-stage renal disease. [81] When Medicare was launched, it initially covered only acute health care situations (e.g., sicknesses or hospitalizations). However, over time, Medicare has added a range of covered benefits (within specified patient parameters) for preventive services, such as for cardiovascular disease (i.e., Medicare Part B covers cardiovascular screening blood tests once every five years), diabetes (up to two screenings per year), hepatitis C, and HIV. [82] Today, in terms of cancer, Medicare provides covered screening benefits for cervical and vaginal cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer (low-dose computerized tomography, or LDCT, once each year), mammograms, and prostate cancer. However, Medicare does not cover cancer screening as a preventive benefit except where Congress has explicitly amended Medicare laws to provide such coverage. Cancer screening was for the first time added as a statutorily covered Medicare benefit when the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 added coverage for pap smear tests (and pelvic exams) to examine for cervical and vaginal cancers. A year later, OBRA of 1990 added a benefit for mammography to examine for breast cancer. Specifically Section 4163 of the 1990 OBRA explicitly added coverage for “screening mammography,” defined as “a radiologic procedure provided to a woman for the purpose of early detection of breast cancer.” Importantly, each of these covered benefits applies only to the modality specified, such that Medicare provides a covered benefit for mammograms (i.e., a radiological procedure) but not for other potential modalities of breast cancer screening. Seven years elapsed before Congress again expanded statutorily covered cancer screening benefits in Medicare, with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 adding prostate and colorectal cancer screening benefits. [83] Importantly, instead of specifying a modality for colorectal cancer screening, the legislation was crafted to provide flexibility in terms of the types of colorectal cancer screening tests covered, including: (A) Screening fecal-occult blood cancer test; (B) Screening flexible sigmoidoscopy; (C) In the case of an individual at high risk for colorectal cancer, screening colonoscopy; (D) Such other tests or procedures, and modifications to tests and procedures under this subsection, with such frequency and payment limits, as the Secretary determines appropriate, in consultation with appropriate organizations. [84] The expansiveness of the covered benefit for colorectal screenings has proven to be prescient, for today it allows for Medicare to provide benefits for colorectal cancer screening modalities that didn’t exist in the late 1990s. For instance, home-based stool DNA tests such as Exact Sciences’ Cologuard can detect microscopic amounts of blood in stool samples and check for certain DNA changes and mutations found in cancerous tumors or precancerous polyps, indicating the potential presence of colon cancer. Recognizing that DNA changes and mutations may differ between colon cancers, the stool DNA test targets multiple DNA markers, which has helped other such tests achieve high detection rates of early-stage colon cancer. [85] In other words, by not limiting itself to particular modalities, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act provided a constructive pathway for innovative colorectal cancer screening approaches to emerge in future years and receive Medicare coverage. Since Congress created the Medicare coverage provision for colon cancer screening in 1997, it has subsequently spawned a wave of innovation in the field, with today many more colon-cancer screening tests available to patients and the percentage of Americans (at the recommended screening ages) taking colon cancer tests now about 50 percent. As a new generation of multi-cancer early detection technologies are coming to the fore, it’s time for Congress to act again, by creating a pathway for Medicare coverage of MCED screening tests. [86] And that’s exactly what bipartisan, bicameral legislation in the “Nancy Gardner Sewell Medicare Multi-Cancer Early Detection Screening Coverage Act ” seeks to do. The Act addresses the misalignment between advances in science and Medicare coverage by permitting Medicare coverage of multi-cancer screening. The legislation creates the authority for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to use an evidence-based process to cover blood-based MCED tests and future test methods once approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, while maintaining CMS’s authority to use an evidence-based process to determine coverage parameters for these new types of tests. The legislation would ensure Medicare beneficiaries are eligible to benefit on a timely basis from MCED screening technologies. The legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support, sponsored by 295 members of the U.S. House of Representatives and 62 U.S. Senators. [87] Cancer has proven to be a relentless and wily enemy. To defeat it, we’re going to need to embrace equally creative solutions and radically new approaches, such as how checkpoint blockading and immunotherapy transformed cancer therapy. MCED heralds the potential for another significant breakthrough to dramatically enhance patients’ lives by detecting cancers earlier, and to put the nation’s cancer response on a more-sustainable economic footing. It’s time for policymakers to embrace this opportunity. The “Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act of 2025” would help ensure prompter coverage of breakthrough devices under Medicare, addressing a long-standing barrier in U.S. healthcare innovation: the delay between FDA approval and Medicare coverage. Such regulatory and reimbursement lags weaken the incentives for firms to invest in high-risk, high-cost devices, since even successful FDA approval may not translate into timely patient access and revenue. By establishing a transitional coverage period for devices designated as “breakthrough” by the FDA, the Act can shorten the time between invention and adoption. This ensures patients benefit sooner from life-saving technologies while strengthening firms’ incentives to continue investing in innovation. The policy is especially timely given recent FDA staffing reductions that have slowed device reviews, and studies showing median review times for high-risk therapeutic medical devices of 0.96 years (11.5 months) under the FDA’s premarket approval pathway. [88] By guaranteeing temporary Medicare coverage, the Act reduces uncertainty surrounding reimbursement timing, giving firms and investors more predictable returns in the interim period. This predictability allows companies to make long-term capital deployment decisions with greater confidence, knowing that Medicare will not be a bottleneck once the FDA has granted breakthrough designation. ITIF has previously warned against policies that have undermined U.S. medical device competitiveness, such as excise taxes on the sales of medical devices and unclear patent subject matter eligibility requirements. [89] In fact, one recent study found that although 17,743 patent applications for medical devices and diagnostics were rejected in the United States as ineligible for patent protection, 1,694 of those were granted by the European Patent Office, by China’s patent office, or both. [90] The “Ensuring Patient Access to Critical Breakthrough Products Act of 2025” moves in the opposite direction: it lowers barriers, strengthens incentives to innovate, and ensures that Medicare beneficiaries and the broader economy gain from a more competitive medical device industry. ITIF commends Congress for examining how emerging technologies and supportive policies can enhance American seniors’ access to breakthrough medical care. Thank you for your consideration. [1] .

Latin American Subnational Innovation Competitiveness Index 2.0 Key Takeaways Introduction The Index Overall Knowledge Economy Globalization Innovation Capacity Policy Recommendations Conclusion Appendices Endnotes,2025-09-22,Stephen Ezell; Meghan Ostertag; Rodrigo Balbontin; Carolina Agurto; Alvaro Monge; Pamela Bernabé; Germán López; Valentina Díaz; Vladimir Maciel; Nicolás Durán; Mario Ottero Cricco; Horacio Arana,"This report ranks more than 200 regions across Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and the United States on 13 commonly available indicators of innovation competitiveness, and offers policymakers a guide to bolstering regional and national innovation capacity. Contents Key Takeaways 1 Introduction . 2 The Index 3 Overall 11 Knowledge Economy 12 Globalization . 20 Innovation Capacity 24 Policy Recommendations 38 Conclusion . 52 Appendices 53 Endnotes 56 Latin America holds significant untapped potential to position itself as a driver of global growth. Accounting for 8 percent of the world’s population and 7.3 percent of global gross domestic product (GDP), along with holding extensive reserves of the world’s copper, lithium, gold, and other critical minerals, the region has the opportunity to become increasingly influential to global trade and supply chains in the coming decades. [1] However, this potential is not new to the region. Countries in Latin America have been stuck in the “middle-income trap” for decades, and previous efforts to upgrade their economies have been seen as a “case of frustrated development.” [2] The Americas’ economies are now entering a more challenging phase. The rapidly shifting global trade environment, set into motion by the sweeping tariffs implemented by the second Trump administration, is expected to increase the cost and complexities of trade. And while Latin America’s strategic resources make it a natural candidate to attract investment, the ongoing uncertainty and institutional instability appear as roadblocks. Additionally, the changing political landscape, caused by social polarization, populist movements, and the largest internal migration in the region’s history, adds to the growing uncertainty surrounding the stability of these nations as economic partners and allies. The world is also entering into an era of accelerated technological change. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) could rapidly increase the gap between rich and developing economies—Latin American countries could fall into the latter category if they continue to underinvest in innovation. On the other hand, AI has the potential to increase productivity in the region, fostering economic growth and innovation. As the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) highlighted in a previous report, maintaining economic strength and international significance depends significantly on promoting innovation and embracing technological progress, which are essential for achieving growth in per-capita GDP. [3] AI has the potential to increase productivity in Latin America, fostering economic growth and innovation, and being a possible lifeboat, saving these nations from the middle-income trap. To fully understand the dynamics of innovation in these countries, it’s critical to explore the subnational factors that contribute to their landscapes. Regional differences in policy, industry, workforce skill levels, and geography—which are often hidden by broad national analyses—influence the economic success and innovativeness of a region. Latin America is one of the world’s most unequal regions; this is also reflected in subnational disparities in technology adoption and global competitiveness. [4] Understanding these regional differences allows policymakers to develop more targeted strategies with a greater chance of success. The Global Innovation Index (GII) is a prominent tool that provides comprehensive assessments of innovation performance on a global and regional scale. The GII offers a multidimensional perspective on innovation, evaluating factors such as research and development (R&D) investments, human capital, and business sophistication, which collectively contribute to a country’s innovation capacity. [5] In line with the GII, ITIF has contributed significantly to the discourse on innovation competitiveness through its series of insightful subnational innovation competitiveness reports, which provide nuanced insights into the intricate relationships between innovation, economic development, and regional competitiveness, offering valuable perspectives for policymakers, businesses, and researchers alike. For instance, ITIF’s “State New Economy Index” report series delves into the role of innovation in driving U.S. state-level economic growth and highlights the transformation of industries through technological advancements. [6] ITIF has further conducted analysis of the U.S. share of a variety of advanced technology industries relative to other nations, and also has conducted that analysis at a more granular level in the United States with the State Hamilton Index. [7] The previous “Latin American Subnational Innovation Competitiveness Index (LASICI)” report, published in 2023, delves into innovation dynamics in the Latin American region, one that has been under-analyzed in comparison to other parts of the world. This study aims to once again showcase the continent’s subnational innovation capabilities, opportunities, and potential future direction by examining the subnational innovation capacity of the same Latin American countries assessed in 2023—Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru—in addition to Argentina. These results are compared to U.S. states. The Latin American Subnational Innovation Competitiveness Index (“LASICI”) captures the innovation performance of more than 200 regions across 7 countries: Argentina (24 provincias), Peru (24 departments), Brazil (27 states), Chile (16 regions), Mexico (32 states), Colombia (33 departments), and the United States (50 states). In this report, we refer to states, provinces, departments, and autonomous cities as regions to simplify the comparative analysis. This report consists of 13 indicators representing the relevant determinants of a successful innovation ecosystem, grouped into three categories: ▪ Knowledge Economy: Indicators measure the educational attainment of the workforce; immigration of knowledge workers; employment in professional, technical, and scientific (PTS) activities; and manufacturing sector productivity. ▪ Globalization: Indicators measure high-tech exports and inward FDI. ▪ Innovation Capacity: Indicators measure a region’s share of households subscribing to broadband Internet, expenditures on R&D, the number of R&D personnel, the creation of new businesses, patent output, the extent of progress toward decarbonization, and venture capital (VC) investment. The most important category of the LASICI is innovation capacity, which accounts for 55 percent of the index’s weight, while the knowledge economy indicators account for 33 percent of the index’s weight, and the globalization indicators account for the remaining 12 percent. Due to variations in data availability across nations and regions, some indicators may include data from varying years by country. For some indicators where subnational data was not available, proxies were created with available data. More information on the proxies used can be found in Appendix C. Table 1: Overall and component performance in the LASICI 2.0 !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var t in a.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data[""datawrapper-height""][t]+""px"";r.style.height=d}}})}(); Several American states lead in this index of subnational innovation competitiveness, with 28 of its 50 states ranked higher than Boyacá, Colombia, which is the best-performing region in Latin America. (See figure 1). Compared to the United States, the Latin American countries in this study have significantly less regional variation in their scores, although many countries have seen outliers emerge since the last iteration of this report in 2023. Several of the top regions in the Latin American nations, and over half of the regions in Mexico, perform better than at least one U.S. state. Figure 1: Maximum, minimum, quartiles, and median of Index scores [8] Coastal states with strong innovation ecosystems and leading research universities, such as Massachusetts and California, emerge as the top performers in both the United States and the overall index. In contrast, more rural, agriculture-, or resource-dependent states like Arkansas and Mississippi rank lower, performing on par with some of the leading regions in Latin America. Across the Latin American countries analyzed, the highest-scoring regions tend to be manufacturing powerhouses, such as Boyacá and Cauca, or major autonomous cities like Ciudad de México and Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (CABA). Mirroring the U.S. pattern, regions whose economies rely heavily on agriculture, mining, or other resource-based industries consistently fall toward the bottom of the index. (See figure 2.) Figure 2: Overall subnational innovation competitiveness scores [9] Why is this important? Knowledge is a fundamental innovation input, and the proportion of a highly educated population is a strong indicator of human capital. [10] In addition, higher education levels correlate with a more dynamic economy, larger disposable income to scale innovations, and economies better integrated with external supply chains. [11] Thus, this indicator measures the share of a region’s 25–64-year-old (“prime age”) population with a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) or higher. Figure 3: Share of 25-64-year-old population with a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) or higher, 2020–2024 [12] The United States, on average, enjoys a more highly educated workforce than most subnational regions in Latin America, with an interstate average of 36 percent of workers classified as highly skilled. Massachusetts—home to top universities and R&D-intensive industries—leads all states, with half its workforce highly educated. By contrast, Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia, where low-knowledge sectors such as agriculture dominate, exhibit the lowest shares, at 26–27 percent. Latin American countries exhibit two distinctive patterns. First, these countries fall into two subgroups. Argentina, Chile, and Mexico have the highest averages, with 29, 23, and 19 percent, respectively. Some subnational territories in these countries have proportions of highly educated workforces similar to that of the United States, or higher, as in the case of Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (CABA) in Argentina. By contrast, Brazil (with an average of 10 percent) and Peru (11 percent) have regions with a proportion of highly skilled workers as low as 6 percent, such as Pará in Brazil and San Martín in Peru. (See figure 3 and figure 4.) Secondly, regions with the highest share of a skilled workforce within Latin American countries are those with dense, urban populations. Latin American countries are characterized by having a large portion of their populations living in a few metropolitan areas; the extreme cases are Argentina and Chile, with 36 and 40 percent of their respective populations living in the capital. In this context, these large urban agglomerations are those that have a more skilled workforce compared to the rest of the country. These regions appear as outliers, such as in Argentina, (CABA, with an average of 57 percent); Brazil (Distrito Federal with 22 percent); Chile (Region Metropolitana with 34 percent); and Mexico (Ciudad de Mexico with 30 percent). Figure 4: Performance in highly skilled workforce [13] Why is this important? Skilled immigration brings together workers with unique educational experiences and backgrounds as a driver of innovative ideas. Skill can be difficult to quantify; thus, this indicator instead measures educational attainment, calculated as a region’s share of foreign-born workers with at least some tertiary education relative to the total regional population. A 2016 ITIF study found that foreign-born workers living in the United States are disproportionately represented among scientists and engineers who produce meaningful innovations, compared to the overall level of immigration in the United States. [14] Similarly, half of Silicon Valley’s AI start-ups have foreign-born founders. [15] Highly educated immigrant populations also raise wages for both domestic- and foreign-born workers. [16] Figure 5: Share of population that is foreign-born and has some tertiary education, 2019–2022 [17] The United States exhibits the greatest number of skilled immigrants among the countries in the Index. With over 1 million international students and an abundance of high-quality universities, the country has been a strong driver of skilled immigration. This is also reflected in the job market. New Jersey, home to several migrant communities and in close proximity to several major metropolitan areas with greater high-wage job opportunities, leads the index with 12 percent, followed by California with the same ratio. Rural and low-income states with relatively smaller knowledge-intensive sectors have lower levels of skilled immigration, including Wyoming, West Virginia, and Mississippi, with 1 percent each. Chile and Argentina both have lower levels of skilled immigration. However, each respective capital city leads the nation in this indicator. In Chile, Region Metropolitana, where Santiago City is located, has a skilled immigration population of 5 percent, while CABA has 3 percent. These regions are more globally connected and offer higher-paying wages relative to the rest of the country. In Mexico, regions bordering the United States observe the highest levels of skilled migration. Baja California and Coahuila, both of which have a prominent advanced manufacturing sector, lead the nation, with 2 percent and 1 percent of their populations comprising skilled immigrants. (See figure 5 and figure 6.) Figure 6: Performance in skilled immigration [18] Why is this important? This indicator measures the share of employees working in professional, technical, and scientific (PTS) activities in each region. This includes, for example, engineers, researchers, and lawyers. PTS services include those needed to facilitate the development, implementation, and commercialization of innovations. Automation and globalization also make high-value-added professional services increasingly important in the modern economy. These occupations are highly knowledge-intensive and therefore harder to offshore. States with greater concentrations in these occupations are thus more resilient. Figure 7: Share of employees in PTS fields, 2023–2024 [19] Mexico is the outlier in the region, with shares of workers in PTS roles ranging from 9 to 26 percent. Most of the regions from the rest of the countries covered by this report, in contrast, exhibit a ratio lower than 10 percent. Ciudad de México leads the index at 26 percent, followed by Nuevo León at 21 percent, and Querétaro and Veracruz at 20 percent. The high ratios of a workforce focused on PTS activities within these regions are explained by the states’ integration into North American supply chains through the United States-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA). Ciudad de México is a banking and finance capital, while Nuevo León specializes in advanced manufacturing, and Querétaro is an aerospace hub. (See figure 7 and figure 8 .) For the rest of the countries, urban centers lead the index in employing workers in PTS roles. In Brazil, Distrito Federal and São Paulo lead the nation with 13 and 11 percent of workers, respectively. In Colombia, departments such as Antioquia, Atlántico, and Caldas (8 percent) lead the country, elevated by the innovation ecosystem in Medellín and the economic activity of the coffee belt. Virginia, with its strong innovation ecosystem and high concentration of government and defense contractors, leads the United States with 15 percent. Rural regions uniformly employ the fewest workers in PTS activities. Regions highly reliant on natural resources, such as those in Brazil’s north and northeast, or Santiago del Estero in Argentina, and Ñuble in Chile, have less than 5 percent of their workforce in PTS jobs. Figure 8: Performance in PTS employment [20] Why is this important? Within manufacturing, high-value-added firms are most often capital-intensive, producing more technologically complex products and organizing their workers to take better advantage of their skills. They typically are more productive, paying higher wages and generating greater value for each hour worked. All else being equal, firms with higher value-added levels are more likely to be able to meet global competitiveness challenges. In this context, gross value added (GVA) measures the contribution to GDP made by an individual producer, industry, or sector. This indicator focuses on the manufacturing sector, and it measures the average GVA per worker on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. Figure 9: PPP-adjusted GVA per worker in the manufacturing sector, 2020–2024 [21] Manufacturing labor productivity is relatively standard across nations, although a clear pattern arises amongst the outliers. In Mexico, Oaxaca ($807,650) and Guerrero ($989,899), both southwestern regions, have greater manufacturing labor productivity than any other region included in the index. Both regions have relatively small manufacturing labor forces and produce high-value products, such as petroleum in Oaxaca and gold and silver in Guerrero. A similar explanation can be used to understand other outliers in the data, such as Moquegua, Peru ($425,225), which is heavily dependent on minerals and natural resources. (See figure 9 and figure 10 .) States with the greatest labor productivity in the United States are also highly concentrated in high-value industries. Louisiana and Wyoming, each with labor productivity exceeding $250,000, rely heavily on their natural gas and petroleum refining industries, while California ($277,144) boasts a strong technology and electronics manufacturing sector. Brazil and Chile each exhibit low manufacturing labor productivity across all regions. Brazil, despite having a large manufacturing sector compared to other countries in the region, primarily focuses on low-knowledge-intensive phases, such as assembly. Chile, in contrast, is competitive in commodities such as base metals and agriculture, rather than manufacturing. Figure 10: Performance in manufacturing labor productivity [22] Why is this important? This indicator measures a region’s exports in the machinery manufacturing; computer and electronic products manufacturing; and electrical equipment, appliances, and components manufacturing industries (North American Industry Classification System “NAICS” 333–335 or equivalent) as a share of GDP. These products represent high-value-added goods that are crucial in the modern global economy. Considering a region’s exports of these goods as a share of its GDP shows to what extent a region has a comparative advantage in high-tech production and export. Moreover, this indicator represents a region’s position in global value chains for the production of these goods. Figure 11: Exports in NAICS 333-335 (or equivalent) as a share of GDP, 2021–2024 [23] High-tech exports in the Americas reveal Mexico as a distinctive country compared to the rest of the sample. The inter-state average of Mexico’s high-tech exports as a share of GDP is 17 percent, more than five 5 higher than Argentina’s 3 percent and 17 times higher than the United States’ 1 percent. (See figure 11 and figure 12) The regional average for Brazil, Colombia, and Peru is close to zero. Mexico’s high rate of high-tech exports is mainly driven by its northern states, which are a crucial part of the Canada-United States-Mexico supply chain. Thus, Mexico’s subnational distribution of high-tech exports is concentrated in states bordering the United States, such as Chihuahua (159 percent), Baja California (86 percent), and Tamaulipas (66 percent). Argentina has two outlier states in terms of high-tech exports: San Juan (19 percent) and Santa Cruz (17 percent). These two states have resource-intensive activities, mainly mining. The manufacturing activities captured in this indicator are likely goods and machinery complementary to the mining extraction process. U.S. exports as a share of GDP are the lowest among Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members, a group of rich countries, with 11 percent of the economy’s size. [24] In this context, the states within the United States average 1 percent of high-tech exports relative to GDP, and all those with the highest ratio border or are near Canada or Mexico, such as New Hampshire (3 percent), Oregon (4 percent), and Texas and Wisconsin (3 percent). Figure 12: Performance in high-tech exports [25] Why is this important? This indicator measures the inward FDI a region receives relative to its GDP, measured as the funds an entity in the region receives from a foreign-based entity to purchase, establish, or expand enterprises. Inward FDI not only spurs domestic economic activity but also facilitates technology transfer between foreign-owned enterprises and local establishments. Foreign owners can also introduce domestic firms to new international markets and help regions carve out positions in global supply chains. Inward FDI has also been associated with greater economic growth in market economies and tends to be more productive and induce greater levels of investment by domestic firms. [26] Figure 13: Inward foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP, 2018–2023 [27] FDI is very unevenly distributed across regions within each country. In most territories, FDI as a share of GDP is well under 1 percent, indicating that most investment, if any, is domestically driven. Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and the United States, in particular, show very low subnational FDI intensity, with only a handful of states, such as New Jersey, Kentucky, and Wyoming, breaking 1 percent. In Peru, only Lima reaches an FDI intensity above 0.5 percent. Argentina’s highest shares are in Buenos Aires (0.3 percent). (See figure 13 and figure 14.) In contrast, Brazil and Mexico stand out for having several states with very high FDI-to-GDP ratios, suggesting both a greater role for foreign-owned firms and strong specialization in export-oriented industries. Brazil’s Amazonas (27.6 percent) and Paraná are clear outliers, reflecting large foreign-owned automotive clusters and natural-resource-based manufacturing. Mexico’s Aguascalientes (15.8 percent) and Sonora (13.8 percent) show similarly high ratios, consistent with Mexico’s integration into North American supply chains under USMCA and its success in attracting FDI into automotive, electronics, and mining sectors. In Chile, most regions have FDI intensities near or below 3 percent. However, Arica y Parinacota and Tarapacá both exceed 60 percent, implying a dependence on foreign-owned mining and extractive industries relative to their small regional GDP bases. This concentration makes these regions extreme outliers compared to the rest of Latin America. Figure 14: Performance in inward FDI [28] Why is this important? This indicator measures broadband adoption at the consumer level—that is, the share of households within each region with broadband Internet connection availability. (All measures of broadband adoption used include satellite adoption as well.) The Internet is now essential to full participation in today’s increasingly digitalized global economy. Internet connectivity has positive externalities for productivity improvements and economic growth. [29] In addition, broadband adoption can enhance innovation capabilities by expanding the market reach of potential consumers, reducing transaction and information costs, and accelerating the product development process. [30] Figure 15: Share of households that have adopted broadband Internet, 2021–2024 [31] Chile, with an average of 93 percent of households with broadband connectivity across regions, and the United States (92 percent) have notably higher broadband Internet adoption rates among all the subnational regions. Ciudad de Mexico (90 percent) is the only subnational area outside these countries with a similar rate of broadband adoption. (See figure 15 and figure 16.) The other countries analyzed show lower and more uneven household broadband adoption. In Mexico, the average is 71 percent, but southern states lag far behind—Chiapas at 44 percent and Oaxaca at 53 percent. In Colombia, where the adoption rate averages 33 percent, only Valle del Cauca (64 percent) and Bogotá (63 percent) surpass the 60 percent threshold, while Amazonas, Guainía, and Vichada remain at 2 percent or lower. Peru averages 29 percent; only Ica, Lima, and Tumbes exceed 50 percent of households. In Brazil (28 percent), Santa Catarina is the lone state above that mark. Increasing broadband Internet penetration thus remains a significant challenge in many Latin American nations and should be viewed as a key priority for policymakers to turbocharge Latin America’s ability to compete in the modern global digital knowledge economy.. Figure 16: Performance in broadband adoption [32] Why is this important? R&D expenditure is an innovation input, as it measures the overall investment in new knowledge and the early stages of technological development within a nation’s or region’s innovation ecosystem. While not all innovation is R&D-based, R&D expenditure is highly correlated with innovation performance, as it reflects the investments to advance in the scientific and technological frontiers. [33] In this context, this indicator measures R&D expenditures in a region relative to its GDP, considering all sectors: business, government, and higher education. Figure 17: R&D expenditures as a share of GDP, 2016–2024 [34] No subnational region in the Latin American countries covered in this report has a GERD that is at least half of the OECD average of 2.7 percent for 2023 The United States invests about 3.5 percent of its GDP into R&D annually, while Brazil’s gross expenditure in R&D (GERD) is 1.2 percent (not shown due to a lack of subnational data), and the rest of the countries covered in this report have a GERD below 0.6 percent. [35] Differences in national GERD are also reflected at the subnational level. Notably, GERD is higher in some U.S. states, such as Massachusetts (9 percent), New Mexico and Washington (8 percent), and California (7 percent), compared to countries with historically high GERD rates, including Israel and South Korea. In contrast, no subnational region in the Latin American countries covered in this report has a GERD that is at least half of the OECD average of 2.7 percent for 2023. [36] (Chile, Colombia, and México are OECD members themselves.) (See figure 17 and figure 18.) The contrast between rich and Latin American economies in a key innovation indicator shows how distinctly different development paths are, partially explaining the persisting productivity stagnation of the region. [37] This data also vividly shows how important it is for Latin American countries to substantially boost their R&D investments if they wish to compete more intensely in the global innovation economy. Figure 18: Performance in R&D intensity [38] Why is this important? R&D personnel are indispensable to conducting R&D activities and turning investments into new productivity-enhancing knowledge and technologies. The R&D workforce also creates spillovers: as workers move to other jobs, their frontier knowledge is applied beyond the research itself. [39] Thus, this indicator measures the number of R&D personnel as a share of all employees in each region. Figure 19: R&D personnel as a share of total employees, 2021–2024 [40] Correlated with the GERD indicator, the United States’ R&D personnel as a share of the total workforce is significantly higher compared to the other countries covered in this study, which is also reflected at the subnational level. The states with the higher ratio of R&D personnel are Washington (21 percent), Massachusetts (18 percent), and California (17 percent). Among the remaining countries, five states in Mexico show a relatively higher percentage of R&D personnel compared to total employees. Three of these states are in or near the capital: Ciudad de México (6 percent), and the states of México and Querétaro (4 percent); and two are close to California in the United States: Baja California and Baja California Sur (4 percent). (See figure 19 and figure 20.) Figure 20: Performance in R&D personnel [41] Why is this important? A patent is an innovation output, used to protect or license an invention. Patents also secure private returns on investment in R&D activities, which are necessary to incentivize these activities and their socially desirable spillover effects. Patent applications per million inhabitants of a region measure the “inventiveness” of its residents. Thus, this indicator focuses on internationally filed patents to mitigate differences in patent qualifications between countries’ patent offices. Figure 21: PCT patent applications per million residents, 2015–2024 [42] In the United States, patents per million residents are distinctively higher than those of the other countries in the Americas covered in this study, with an interstate average of 124 patent applications per million residents. The states with the higher ratio of patent applications are those with a strong university system and a prevalence of knowledge-intensive industries, such as Massachusetts (502 patents per million residents), California (380), Oregon (376), and Washington (363). Peru’s departments average 19 patent applications per million people. This figure is notably influenced by the Junín region, with a ratio of 172. This department is home to the National University of the Center of Peru, which is among the most active in submitting patent applications in the country. [43] Additionally, there are reports of patents in some niche agricultural products in Junín, such as the “maca,” which likely affect this indicator. [44] (See figure 21 and figure 22.) Patent applications per million residents among the rest of the countries covered in this report are generally lower than the U.S. state with the lowest rate in the country (Mississippi, with 20 patent applications per million). Some regions present as outliers in this group of countries, such as Santa Fe (46 patents per million) and CABA (38) in Argentina (which are driven by university research), and Coahuila (42) in México, with a robust manufacturing sector. Figure 22: Performance in patent applications [45] Why is this important? Newcomer firms capable of challenging incumbents are essential for a business environment that rewards innovation and competitiveness. This indicator measures the share of a region’s business enterprises that were established in the previous period. The business creation indicator is limited, as it does not capture business turnover, does not differentiate among industries with low or high knowledge intensity, and does not distinguish between subsistence-driven and competition-driven new startups. Absent a better alternative at the cross-national regional level, this indicator reflects a region’s overall economic resilience and regional competitiveness. Figure 23: Economy-wide enterprise birth rate, 2017–2024 [46] Brazil and Colombia’s business creation rates are significantly higher than those of the rest of the countries in the sample, with an average of 19 percent and 21 percent, respectively. These higher rates of business creation are a sign of the limitations of the data, likely capturing the pervasiveness of subsistence businesses—i.e., mostly single-person microenterprises. In these cases, higher rates of business creation are the consequence of a weak job market, pushing workers to frequently enter and exit paid jobs, and leading to the creation of subsistence businesses in between. (See figure 23 and figure 24.) The United States exhibits the highest business creation rates among the rest of the countries analyzed, with an average of 7 percent of businesses being new. Iowa and West Virginia, with a 5 percent average, are the U.S. states with the lowest business creation rates. Both states have strong ties with resource-based industries, and their relatively small population does not offer a significant consumer base. Business creation in Chile, Mexico, and Peru follows similar patterns, with an average rate of 3–4 percent. Tlaxcala in Mexico, with a business creation rate of 6 percent, and Arica y Parinacota in Chile, with 1 percent, stand out as outliers at the extremes of the distribution. In contrast, Argentina has a business creation rate averaging less than 1 percent, highlighting the lack of business dynamism and stagnated competitiveness in its economy. Figure 24: Performance in business creation [47] Why is this important? As the world endeavors to combat climate change, decarbonization is of paramount importance. Regions’ ability to innovate sustainably to achieve a reduction in and the efficient use of carbon and other greenhouse gases will determine their long-term competitiveness, as well as their national economic prosperity. This indicator measures carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other greenhouse gas efficiency per unit of output (as measured by PPP-adjusted GDP). It is noted that more-developed regions may have a slight advantage in this indicator due to their somewhat more service-oriented economies. As policymakers look to improve efficiency and reduce overall emissions, they will take their lead from those regions that are devising new solutions and innovative technologies. Figure 25: Metric tons of CO2 emissions per $10,000 of PPP-adjusted GDP, 2018–2023 [48] Emissions intensity is highly correlated with the socio-economic development of a region, with most urbanized and economically advanced areas showing very low CO 2 emissions per unit of GDP. For instance, Ciudad de México, Bogotá, and several Mexican states with a significant tourism sector report emissions near zero, reflecting service-heavy economies with limited manufacturing activities. Similarly, major U.S. coastal states such as California, New York, and Massachusetts have relatively low emissions intensity, driven by their high-value, low-emissions industries, such as biopharma, finance, and software development. Conversely, sparsely populated and resource-dependent regions with low GDPs dominate the list of high emitters. For example, Brazil’s Acre (82) and Rondônia (62), two of the country’s poorest regions where deforestation and development contribute to industrial emissions, top the list. In Mexico, Campeche (24) is home to the Mexican state-owned petroleum corporation, PEMEX, which elevates industrial emissions, making it the highest in the country. Similarly, North Dakota (17) and Wyoming (10) lead the United States in emissions per unit of GDP, reflecting each state’s dependence on fossil-fuel industries and low GDPs. (See figure 25 and figure 26.) Figure 26: Performance in carbon efficiency [49] Why is this important? This indicator examines a region’s total venture capital investment (measured as VC-receiving firms) relative to the size of its GDP. VC represents a form of business financing wherein investors provide funds to early-stage companies in exchange for equity in their firms. Given the considerable uncertainty regarding start-ups’ success potential, VC investment assumes higher risks than other forms of investment. Accordingly, VC investment is often intended for companies with real or perceived high-growth potential, often associated with their innovative technology use or business model design. A region’s receipt of VC investment reflects both the innovativeness of its start-up ecosystem as well as the commitment of its firms to lead in crucial technologies such as AI, biotechnology, clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and robotics. Figure 27: VC investment received as a percentage of GDP, 2021–2024 [50] Most regions in Latin America report virtually no activity in VC investment, with any VC activity concentrated in large urban areas or near extractive activities. In Argentina, only Mendoza and Tucumán receive investment greater than 0.2 percent of GDP, indicating that the national VC ecosystem is clustered in a few entrepreneurial hubs. Colombia and Peru have virtually no measurable VC penetration outside of Bogotá and Huancavelica, Peru, each with 0.1 percent of GDP. (See figure 27 and figure 28 .) Brazil stands out as the most heterogeneous VC landscape among the Latin American countries. Paraná (1.5 percent) and São Paulo (1.1 percent) are national leaders, reflecting their status as hubs for fintech, software, and industrial innovation. Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Norte also see VC investment greater than 0.5 percent of GDP. Though these shares are still modest by global standards, they show that Brazil’s VC market has achieved a degree of growth unseen by many other countries in the region. The United States remains the most VC-intensive market, with Massachusetts (1.8 percent) and California (1.7 percent) leading the country. Other states with strong innovation ecosystems, including New York, Washington, and Maryland, also report significant investment, indicating that capital investment continues to cluster around advanced technology industries such as biotech, software, and technology. Figure 28: Performance in VC [51] While the country has historically produced a large number of high-quality university graduates, educational performance at the primary and secondary levels remains troubling. National assessments such as Pruebas Aprender and international benchmarks, such as PISA, consistently reveal deficiencies in mathematics, science, and reading. Increasing investment and improving the quality of education are critical, as peer countries achieve stronger outcomes with comparable levels of spending. Argentina must expand both the number and quality of graduates in STEM fields while also addressing structural inefficiencies in higher education. Fewer than 30 percent of students complete their degrees on time, and programs designed to take four years can stretch to as many as nine. [52] This delay represents not only a waste of institutional resources but also an opportunity cost for students, who are unable to enter the job market earlier. In a rapidly evolving global economy, shorter and more practice-oriented programs—supplemented by specialized master’s degrees—would better prepare graduates to adapt and innovate. Likewise, the imbalance in fields of study is concerning; only 1.9 percent of graduates earn degrees in computer science, compared with 13.4 percent in law. Such a skewed distribution undermines Argentina’s ability to cultivate the workforce needed to compete in a technology-driven world. [53] Investing in higher-quality education is essential, and the strategic use of AI offers promising opportunities. While there is no established blueprint for using AI in training, recent World Bank research demonstrates its potential: in a six-week pilot, AI-enabled interventions produced learning gains equivalent to 1.5 to 2 years of progress under a business-as-usual scenario. Remarkably, the program achieved 3.2 equivalent years of schooling (EYOS) for every $100 invested, highlighting AI’s potential to deliver cost-effective, scalable improvements in educational outcomes. [54] Investing in education, particularly at the primary and secondary levels, should be a national priority. According to the World Bank, every U.S. dollar a government invests in education yields, on average, a $20.37 increase in GDP. Indeed, recent research indicates that education investments have accounted for an extraordinary 50 percent of global economic growth over the past three decades—underscoring the central role of human capital development in driving prosperity. [55] Argentina must deepen its integration into international markets. Years of relative isolation have increased inefficiencies across key industries, limiting competitiveness. The pending free trade agreement with the European Union represents an important step forward. By eliminating tariffs on 90 percent of bilateral trade, the agreement would significantly reduce costs for exporters on both sides. It would also mark the largest trade pact ever negotiated by Mercosur, a group of South American countries, granting Argentina greater access to one of the world’s largest markets and positioning the country to strengthen its role in global value chains. FDI attraction is another policy need. The main program is the Régimen de Incentivo a Grandes Inversiones (RIGI), an incentive scheme, which provides long-term stability and predictability for projects exceeding $200 million. RIGI offers 30 years of legal guarantees to investors and targets strategic sectors such as industrial forestry, tourism, infrastructure, mining, technology, steel, energy, and oil and gas. Incentives include reduced corporate tax rates, accelerated depreciation, value-added tax (VAT) credits, and exemptions from import and export duties, measures designed to enhance Argentina’s competitiveness and encourage large-scale, long-term capital inflows. Since its implementation, seven projects worth more than $13 billion have been approved within the first year. The pending free trade agreement between Argentina and the EU would eliminate tariffs on 90 percent of bilateral trade, making it the largest trade pact ever negotiated by Mercosur, and allowing the country strengthen its role in global value chains. Nevertheless, further progress is needed to strengthen institutional security and consolidate investor confidence. In this regard, the Ministry of Deregulation and Efficiency plays a critical role in sustaining pro-competition reforms by continuing to eliminate red tape that constrains business creation. Complementary labor market reforms are also essential to accelerate hiring and reduce costs for firms, while at the same time ensuring an effective social safety net for workers. Together, these measures would create a more dynamic business environment, boost productivity, and position Argentina to compete more effectively in the global economy. Argentina’s knowledge economy already accounts for the country’s third-largest export sector, yet it retains considerable room for further growth. The nation has produced more than 11 unicorns (startups with a valuation over $1 billion), and an estimated 95 percent of knowledge-based services are exported—primarily to the United States, Europe, and Asia. This underscores both the global competitiveness of Argentina’s digital and innovation-driven industries and the strategic importance of policies that can expand their scale and sophistication. [56] Argentina’s investment in research and development remains low by international standards, averaging just 0.54 percent of GDP. Since 2017, public funding for R&D in universities has been steadily declining, further constraining the country’s capacity to generate innovation and strengthen its knowledge economy. [57] In addition, patent production by universities in Argentina remains very low. A key setback was the introduction of the Pautas de Examen de Patentabilidad in 2012, which made it more difficult to register patents and disproportionately affected innovation-intensive sectors such as biotechnology. This regulatory barrier has further constrained the country’s ability to translate research into commercial applications and weakened the link between universities and industry. [58] Moreover, Argentina has not signed the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), which allows inventors to seek patent protection across multiple jurisdictions through a single international application. These gaps in R&D investment and intellectual property policy hinder Argentina’s ability to commercialize research, attract foreign investment, and position itself as a competitive player in global innovation networks. [59] Efforts to modernize Argentina’s intellectual property regime have faced pushback from local pharmaceutical companies that benefit from restrictive patentability standards. It is therefore essential that the Ministry of Deregulation and Efficiency review and update local criteria for patent approval to align with global best practices. Equally important is strengthening the role of universities in the innovation ecosystem. A system that ties university funding more closely to patent production and industry collaboration would encourage greater commercialization of research. Expanding international research partnerships, particularly in sectors where multinational firms could establish operations in Argentina, would further enhance technology transfer, attract investment, and integrate the country more deeply into global innovation networks. Argentina’s patent production is hindered by the Pautas de Examen de Patentabilidad, which makes it more difficult to register patents and disproportionately affected innovation-intensive sectors. Argentina’s innovation ecosystem also requires diversification of funding sources and stronger institutional linkages. For decades, the military has faced chronic underinvestment. Yet, strategic engagement in research and joint projects with universities, alongside greater collaboration with international partners, could provide an important channel for advancing dual-use technologies and innovation spillovers, even under current fiscal constraints. Finally, Argentina’s VC market remains highly concentrated in just a few regions, limiting opportunities for entrepreneurs nationwide. Expanding VC availability will require targeted policies, such as tax incentives for firms that invest in local venture capital funds. Such measures could help scale startups with regional and global connections, positioning them to join Latin America’s growing network of high-growth companies and complement Argentina’s existing knowledge economy strengths. A pro-business agenda should enable companies to invest more effectively in the skills of their employees, including greater flexibility to transfer stock as part of compensation through Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPPs) administered via payroll deductions. At the same time, if Argentina seeks to expand its workforce in critical industries, it must improve access to the limited number of firms currently offering high-quality training opportunities. Internships represent an important pathway, yet the existing framework—established under Law No. 26,427 and its Regulatory Joint Resolutions No. 825/2009 and No. 338/2009—is highly restrictive. The law discourages participation by imposing rigid quotas that penalize larger companies, ultimately reducing the supply of opportunities for students and limiting the development of industry-ready talent. The analysis of the knowledge economy component reveals significant disparities among Brazilian states, particularly regarding the development of qualified human capital and integration into knowledge-intensive activities. The Federal District, São Paulo, Santa Catarina, and Minas Gerais lead in indicators such as a highly educated population and employment in professional, technical, and scientific roles. Conversely, states in the North and Northeast—such as Maranhão, Pará, and Alagoas—show substantially lower levels, reflecting structural challenges in education, employability, and technological capability. To address these gaps and enhance knowledge-based competitiveness, a comprehensive strategy is essential. This includes prioritizing investment in higher education and technical training, especially in STEM; fostering partnerships between universities and industry; and implementing mechanisms to retain local talent. These efforts should be accompanied by incentives for innovation in strategic sectors, thereby fostering the development of knowledge-based local ecosystems. In the globalization component, there is a clear asymmetry across states in terms of international integration and capacity to attract FDI. While Amazonas, Minas Gerais, and São Paulo report higher FDI levels, most other states—especially those in the North and Northeast—remain marginal players. High-tech exports are similarly limited, with only a few isolated exceptions. Digital connectivity, as measured by broadband adoption, shows moderate progress in Southern and Southeastern states such as Santa Catarina and Paraná, but still requires substantial expansion in more remote regions. To promote more equitable and effective global integration, a national strategy is recommended. This strategy should include incentives for high-tech exports, the universalization of broadband, the creation of special economic zones, the strengthening of Regional Investment Promotion Agencies (RIPAs), and the improvement of subnational business environments. These actions must be supported with federal, state, and municipal coordination to ensure alignment and cooperation between public and private efforts. The innovation capacity component reveals a landscape of both challenges and opportunities across Brazilian states. While progress has been made in business creation—particularly in the Federal District, Santa Catarina, and Goiás—indicators such as venture capital, broadband access, R&D personnel, patent applications, and carbon efficiency still reveal significant regional disparities. R&D intensity remains uniformly low across the country, highlighting the urgent need for tailored policies to stimulate local innovation. Furthermore, the volume of venture capital is still critically limited, even in more developed centers such as São Paulo, which restricts the growth potential of innovative startups. R&D intensity and VC investment remain uniformly low across Brazil, highlighting the urgent need for tailored policies to stimulate local innovation. To strengthen national innovation capacity, a cohesive set of actions is recommended, including enhanced scientific and technological infrastructure, increased investment in applied research, promotion of intellectual property culture and protection, expansion of startup incubation and acceleration programs in underserved regions, and development of regional seed and venture capital funds. Sustainability practice—especially in agribusiness, mining, and the Amazon region—must also be central to Brazil’s innovation agenda, ensuring responsible and inclusive growth. A key consideration is that Chile is a unitary country, so it is still difficult to obtain disaggregated data by region. Different administrations have sought to decentralize the country while maintaining a unitary regime. The first essential step for this is to have statistics and data disaggregated at the regional level to know the conditions and particularities of each one of them. Total factor productivity has remained stagnant for almost two decades, and since 2020 has decreased about 0.9 percent annually. Moreover, labor productivity has grown slowly in the last decade, with an average of 0.9 percent annually, after having grown at about 2.5 percent annually between 1990 and 2013. Low economic growth has also limited progress in productivity and innovation. Although the proportion of workers with a bachelor’s degree is similar to that of OECD countries, the proportion with a master’s degree or a doctorate is much lower than that observed at the international level, which means that, in the aggregate, Chile is far behind those countries in terms of advanced human capital. In addition, there is a gap in the quality of education at all levels of training and job skills. The 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (which measures the abilities of 15-year-old students to face real-life challenges) shows a relative gap of 60 points (472 OECD vs. 412 Chile) in mathematics, 28 points in reading comprehension (476 OECD vs. 448 Chile), and 41 points in science (485 OECD vs. 444 Chile) compared with the OECD average. Meanwhile, the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC, which measures the cognitive competencies of the adult population linked to work performance) shows a gap of 42 points in reading comprehension (260 OECD vs. 218 Chile), and 49 (263 OECD vs. 214 Chile) in mathematics. Chile needs to adopt an aggressive policy of job training and retraining in the short term. In particular, the job training system needs to be reformed, as it has not delivered the expected results. A reformed job training system must be integrated with formal education and provide flexibility, allowing workers to validate their learning and facilitate the continuation of studies in professional institutes and universities. Chile has 35 Economic-Trade Agreements with 65 economies around the world, representing more than 88 percent of the world’s GDP. Similarly, the proportion of immigrants with higher education is relatively low. Chile has faced significant migration flows in recent years, and these new waves of migration, unlike previous ones, have lower levels of schooling. New migrants are typically employed in low-skill jobs. Thus, the adult immigrant population with higher education is less than 3 percent of the population, while the migrant population amounts to 10.5 percent. Given the relevance and high levels of migration in recent years, progress should be made in eliminating restrictions on the hiring of foreign labor, which currently has a limit of 15 percent of the payroll. This could also help knowledge-intensive sectors attract foreign workers and enable local workers to learn from them. Chile has the network of Economic-Trade Agreements with the greatest access to the world’s GDP, according to the OECD. In this regard, Chile has 35 Economic-Trade Agreements with 65 economies around the world, representing more than 88 percent of the world’s GDP. [60] Most recently, Chile joined the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in 2022. As of 2024, the total amount traded with this bloc is the highest in Chile’s entire network of multilateral agreements with the world. [61] For the time being, what remains is to continue deepening trade relations between Chile and the world. For example, negotiations are currently underway to modernize the free trade agreement with South Korea to liberalize tariffs on Chilean products such as beef and certain fruits and vegetables. Chile has forged (but should expand) the partial scope agreement with India, which considers the extension of tariff preferences and regulatory considerations, among other aspects. Chile’s corporate tax rate of 27 percent is above the OECD and world average (24 percent), which disincentivizes FDI inflows. Another latent problem that has slowed down investment in the country is the worsening of “permitting,” which consists of the excessive amount of paperwork required for the development of investment and infrastructure projects and the long delay in their approval. Although several bills are currently being discussed in Parliament, they are not enough to comprehensively address the problem and generate significant change. Therefore, progress must be made in reformulating the permitting system to reduce the processing times for environmental and sectoral permits effectively. In addition, consideration should be given to establishing new special incentive mechanisms for technology companies or innovation companies that set up in Chile. Chile has made great progress in broadband coverage and currently maintains high broadband coverage and adoption. Aggregate data from the beginning of 2024 shows that 94.3 percent of Chilean households have Internet access. [62] The task is to continue expanding these connections to rural areas of the country. Current R&D spending amounts to 0.3 percent of GDP. Developed countries—which are important producers of natural resources—such as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, invest 1.8 percent, 1.6 percent, and 1.5 percent of their GDP on R&D, respectively. Similarly, these countries have between 4,500 and 5,000 workers performing some form of R&D per million inhabitants, while in Chile, there are only about 500 people per million inhabitants. Chile should move toward such levels of public and private spending and researchers dedicated to R&D. Different administrations have proposed to move toward an expenditure of 1 percent of GDP; however, this has not yet materialized. In a way, there is inertia in spending and the number of researchers, so to achieve this, it would be necessary to adopt measures to change the incentives of economic agents, which has not happened. Current R&D investment in Chile is 0.3 percent of GDP, while other natural-resource-based developed economies invest up to 1.8 percent of GDP. In addition, it is necessary to foster greater competition in the markets so that companies, especially leading companies, are compelled to innovate in order to remain competitive. It is also necessary to adapt the Chilean institutions that encourage development and provide VC financing. The Chilean economic development agency, CORFO (Corporación de Fomento de la Producción), should become a more technical and autonomous body, allowing Chile to deepen the VC market, with a long-term strategic vision. In Colombia, highly skilled labor remains concentrated in the main cities of the Andean region, and parts of the Caribbean and Pacific regions. The development of capabilities in other areas of the country remains limited, which might lead to widening regional disparities. This issue is closely related to low levels of tertiary education coverage throughout the country. Addressing this requires public policies that increase education investment beyond major urban centers and promote advanced training in STEM, applied sciences, and digital skills. Strengthening a knowledge-based workforce demands expanded access to this type of training in traditionally underserved areas, along with effective decentralization of qualified human capital as a means for building a more-competitive, equitable, and technologically prepared economy. Moreover, low labor productivity continues to be a critical barrier to competitive economic growth. In this context, accelerating digitalization across the public and private sectors is essential, not only to strengthen the ICT ecosystem but also to improve the efficiency of all economic sectors through digitization, as well as the adoption of emerging technologies such as AI, automation, robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced data analytics. Colombia faces structural challenges in transitioning from an economy primarily based on raw material exports, typically with low added value, toward one focused on the production and export of technology-intensive goods and services. In this context, it is a priority to advance in the formulation and implementation of national policies that foster the development and adoption of digital technologies in all regions of Colombia, while promoting the implementation of emerging technologies such as AI. According to the Central Bank of Colombia (Banco de la República), FDI contracted by 17 percent in 2024 compared to 2022. This decline underscores the urgent need to strengthen the country’s business environment. It is essential to ensure legal certainty, regulatory stability, and coherence in public policy, which are key factors in attracting foreign investment in strategic sectors such as telecommunications, data infrastructure, and AI. Challenges stemming from ambiguous public policies and increasing regulatory uncertainty have weakened foreign capital inflows in Colombia. FDI contracted by 17 percent from 2022 to 2024. Moreover, challenges stemming from ambiguous public policies and increasing regulatory uncertainty have further weakened foreign capital inflows and hindered the development of a robust information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. Overcoming these obstacles requires a modern, transparent, and predictable regulatory framework, developed in coordination with stakeholders across the productive and technological ecosystem, to build trust and support long-term investment. Although Colombia has made some progress in recent years, significant challenges remain in strengthening its innovation capacity. A central priority must be the expansion and modernization of the country’s connectivity infrastructure, including continued efforts to deploy mobile, fixed, and satellite networks, as well as serving rural and remote areas. Accelerating the deployment of 5G technology is crucial because it acts as a vital driver of digital transformation in both the public and private sectors. Furthermore, public investment is necessary to boost the creation of new businesses, support patent development, and encourage technology transfer across various industries. Furthermore, as Colombia advances its digital transformation agenda, it must incorporate environmental sustainability into its strategy. The energy demands of emerging technologies highlight the importance of pursuing structured and carefully planned decarbonization efforts. Improving the carbon efficiency of digital infrastructure and aligning energy policy with innovation objectives will be essential for creating a sustainable and resilient technological system transition. Mexico needs to strengthen its education system to include, across all levels, the teaching of knowledge and skills aligned with the macrotrends shaping the future of workforce dynamics, such as AI, information processing, robotics, and automation. This requires teacher training and curriculum design investments so the system can anticipate and adapt rapidly to the fastest-growing jobs, such as big data specialists, fintech engineers, and software and application developers, while fostering enduring foundational skills. Also, the growing need for climate change mitigation and adaptation further underscores the importance of developing professionals with green skills. Embedding sustainability into skill development and industrial growth will position Mexico as a competitive, knowledge-based economy and a responsible global actor in addressing environmental challenges. Besides enhancing the education system, Mexico must advance reforms that promote skill development through a Triple Helix approach—fostering collaboration between government, the private sector, and academia—while adapting this strategy to regional contexts. Persistent disparities in educational attainment and industrial specialization between the north, center, and south of the country require targeted regional innovation strategies. These strategies should identify and build upon each state’s comparative advantages by mapping local educational resources and industrial networks. Therefore, aligning these insights with labor market demands, government action, and existing infrastructure will enable the creation of locally relevant skill-development programs that address regional gaps and leverage unique strengths. The recommendation made in the 2023 LASICI report to pair technical expertise with soft skills in workforce development remains highly relevant, as labor market demands have not shifted. Employers continue to seek professionals who combine technical proficiency with adaptability, communication, and problem-solving. Expanding dual education models—through partnerships between academia and industry—offers a proven path to align classroom learning with real-world experience, ensuring that graduates are technically capable and workplace-ready. Similarly, strengthening Mexico’s entrepreneurial ecosystem remains essential. Barriers persist: access to financing is limited, bureaucratic procedures are cumbersome, and protections for tax compliance and intellectual property remain weak. Revitalizing public programs to address these gaps would stimulate high-value business creation, foster innovation, and expand participation in global markets—bringing Mexico closer to becoming a resilient, knowledge-based economy. Finally, migration trends reveal continuity with 2023 findings: Mexico receives a steady inflow of high-skilled migrants—primarily professionals, academics, scientists, and researchers—from the United States, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela. [63] This is occurring alongside restrictive U.S. migration policies that are curbing Mexican outflows. These dynamics pose opportunities and challenges for Mexico’s labor market absorption capacity. Mexico should design a comprehensive strategy to integrate high-skilled migrants into its economy. This could include establishing processes to recognize and validate foreign academic or technical credentials, enabling their expertise to benefit priority workforce sectors. Additionally, targeted language training, cultural adaptation initiatives, and professional networking programs would facilitate smoother integration and maximize the contributions of skilled migrants. Rising trade tensions and the prospect of persistent U.S. tariffs are reshaping Mexico’s global economic position. Given the country’s deep integration with the U.S. economy—Mexico was the United States’ largest trading partner in 2024, with bilateral trade exceeding $510 billion—any change in tariff regimes has direct implications for the economy, supply chains, and investments. [64] The convergence of U.S. tariff decisions with the scheduled review of the USMCA at the end of 2025 has amplified uncertainty, creating a more adverse climate for exporters and foreign investors. This places Mexico at a critical juncture in defining its trade strategy and negotiating stance. While northern and central states such as Nuevo León, Chihuahua, Baja California, Coahuila, Guanajuato, and Querétaro have long been integrated into export-oriented manufacturing and benefited from regional value chains, the challenge remains to extend these advantages to southern states such as Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Guerrero. Achieving this requires deliberate policy action to reduce structural disparities and enhance competitiveness. Strategic investments in highways, railways, intermodal terminals, and port facilities would physically connect the south with the country’s principal economic hubs, reducing logistics costs and facilitating participation in North American value chains. These improvements can be improved by leveraging USMCA provisions on trade facilitation, customs modernization, and technical cooperation. Energy security is equally essential for attracting industry to the south. Expanding renewable generation capacity would reduce production costs and align with Mexico’s sustainability commitments. This positions the region as a competitive destination for agro-processing, textiles, automotive components, and clean technology manufacturing. However, tariff volatility underscores the need for Mexico to pursue diversification beyond North America simultaneously. [65] Strengthening trade and investment ties with the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and South America and targeted FDI promotion in underdeveloped regions can mitigate overdependence on the U.S. market. In the face of growing uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs, Mexico can leverage innovation as a core pillar of its economic strategy. Rather than solely focusing on reactive trade measures, public policy should integrate a forward-looking innovation agenda that enhances resilience and competitiveness across sectors. The federal government’s recent announcement of 11 economic hubs—designed to stimulate investment and promote well-being through tax incentives—presents a strategic entry point. [66] These hubs should be explicitly structured to support innovation ecosystems. Enhanced incentives should be offered to firms implementing clean energy and sustainable technologies in high-emission states such as Campeche, Tamaulipas, and Guanajuato. To maximize impact, these economic hubs should host dedicated innovation clusters. Concentrating talent, infrastructure, and investment in these zones fosters collaboration between researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The co-location of financial incentives and innovation support services accelerates the transition of research and development outputs into commercially viable products, strengthening the region’s positioning as a business-friendly destination and a center of technological leadership. Recent reforms to Mexico’s intellectual property framework add another critical support layer. The Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI) has introduced accelerated patent procedures to reduce processing times from an average of 4.3 years to 3 years or fewer, aligning with international standards. [67] Ongoing modifications to the Federal Law on Industrial Property aim to provide provisional patents, strengthen inventors’ rights, and establish direct economic incentives for patenting in public research institutions. These measures could benefit large exporters and strengthen domestic industries in strategic fields such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. The Mexican government’s recent announcement of 11 economic hubs—designed to stimulate investment and promote well-being through tax incentives—should be explicitly structured to support innovation ecosystems, fostering collaboration between researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. To close Mexico’s persistent gap in technology transfer, innovation policy should directly link patenting reforms with mechanisms that ensure inventions reach the market. This requires strengthening connections with universities and research centers and expanding public-private partnership models for commercialization. In this way, future advances in intellectual property legislation can catalyze innovation-led growth across strategic industries. One of the structural challenges that continues to hinder Peru’s ability to consolidate a solid innovation ecosystem is the limited availability of highly qualified human capital in its workforce, which continues to restrict its performance in the dimension of the knowledge economy. These gaps originate from very early ages, with high levels of anemia and malnutrition among children under five years of age, and persist throughout the school years, where performance in reading comprehension and mathematics remains insufficient. Added to this is the high socioeconomic segregation in the education system. According to PISA 2022, Peru’s segregation index is among the highest in the region, reflecting low social mobility: students’ socioeconomic backgrounds significantly condition their academic and professional development opportunities, limiting the emergence of a broad and diverse talent base capable of contributing to innovation. [68] Additionally, a growing problem is the high number of young people who neither study nor work—so-called “ninis” in Spanish—which represents a significant loss of productive potential and reduces the pool of human capital available for higher value-added activities and knowledge generation. From a structural perspective, addressing these challenges requires effective policies for the comprehensive development of early childhood and the sustained improvement of educational quality, as well as reducing heterogeneity in the quality of technical and university education, narrowing the gaps between Lima and the provinces and between public and private institutions. [69] Key actions include promoting technical education in the final years of secondary education, strengthening the accreditation processes of higher education institutions. These institutionalizing mechanisms progressively reduce the gap between training supply and labor demand, including greater coordination with the productive sector through modalities such as dual training and internships, fostering the development of digital and transversal skills, and expanding financing solutions such as scholarships and student loans, prioritizing strategic sectors. [70] On the other hand, in recent years, there has been an intensification of emigration, reflecting that the Peruvian labor market and development conditions do not provide the necessary opportunities. At the same time, Peru has not fully capitalized on the migration inflows, as a significant number of Venezuelan migrants are highly qualified professionals who could help close training gaps in strategic sectors. This dual dynamic—the loss of national talent and the underutilization of foreign talent—is a warning sign, as it implies the loss or underutilization of capacities that could enhance innovation, knowledge transfer, and the development of higher-value-added sectors. According to PISA 2022, Peru’s segregation index is among the highest in the region, meaning students’ socioeconomic backgrounds significantly condition their academic and professional development opportunities. To address this issue, it is essential to implement policies that strengthen the retention of national talent and the better utilization of foreign talent. This includes enhancing opportunities for specialization and professional development, providing competitive working conditions, recognizing degrees and certifications, and promoting linkage programs between migrant professionals and strategic productive sectors. Likewise, measures such as streamlining work permit procedures and adopting tax incentives for non-residents can encourage the attraction of foreign or repatriated professionals, within the framework of inter-institutional agreements involving academia, and the public and private sectors. Other obstacles that continue to affect the development of a robust, innovative ecosystem are the high level of informality in the labor force and lack of safety. Informality reflects productivity gaps in the labor force and the lack of competitiveness, limiting investments to train the workforce and accelerate innovation. Therefore, in addition to reinforcing human capital formation, it is essential to promote a more favorable legal and institutional environment for the creation of formal jobs, implement active labor policies that promote youth labor insertion and training, and address productive heterogeneity by facilitating the adoption of technologies, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Crime and the increase of illegal economies create resource allocation problems with a negative impact on private investment and productivity. For example, both firms and households need to allocate a higher share of their budget to safety. Additionally, the country’s higher presence of illegal economies, particularly in politics, expands the scope of clientelism and corruption, resulting in detrimental microeconomic and sectoral policies. In this context, the country requires significant efforts to combat insecurity and reduce (or eliminate) the penetration of illicit markets, thereby creating more space for innovative private decisions and public policies. In recent decades, Peru has been characterized by opening its economy and attracting FDI. However, to reinforce the globalization pillar, it is necessary to deepen these strategies so that they promote export diversification and the expansion of high-value-added exports. In this sense, regarding the exportable supply, transversal policies (e.g., market opening, compliance with international standards), sectoral policies (e.g., public-private coordination spaces, promotion of strategic sectors with special labor and tax regimes), and specific policies—such as gaining efficiencies in logistics services, administrative simplification, and digitization—become a relevant need. [71] Likewise, it is important to reinforce the role of the investment promotion agency to expand investment in areas of science, innovation, technology, and development;. This should be complemented with measures to improve the business environment in the country, namely: strengthen the regulatory framework, streamline bureaucratic processes, improve access to and quality of public services, and enhance operational efficiency. [72] Peru needs to resume its economic growth path through specific measures, such as institutionalizing regulatory quality and impact studies, and solving critical bureaucratic barriers in R&D sectors. [73] Peru’s performance in terms of innovation outcomes (including patent applications) is quite modest. This occurs due to existing distortions in the research and development ecosystem, with disarticulation of innovation policies, insufficient capital, limited capabilities, and low participation of universities in commercializing research. Thus, it is necessary to advance in three priorities: ▪ Governance and institutional framework of the innovation system: Avoid the dispersion of initiatives based on an articulating approach between different actors and government levels. One of the important reforms that is under debate in Peru is the creation of the Science and Technology Ministry to overcome the problems mentioned, as well as the strengthening of the Productive, Innovation, and Technological Transfer Centers (“CITE”). ▪ Increase the level of investment in R&D with a balanced participation of the various areas of knowledge in public financing. ▪ Promote the allocation of resources with an emphasis on strengthening science, technology, and innovation (STI) capacities. [74] Efforts at two levels should also complement the above initiatives. On the one hand, promoting digitization and, second, the adoption of more environmentally friendly technologies. Internet connectivity in Peru is low in part due to infrastructure shortages; the government should promote the expansion of fiber optic networks, promote greater adoption of 4G and 5G technologies, and reinforce regulation. [75] Regarding green technologies, a priority aspect is to advance in the transformation of the country’s energy matrix. Furthermore, the country’s digital maturity advances slowly. The government needs to foster the adoption of emerging technologies with a coordinated policy framework that incentivizes investment in digital infrastructure, promotes digital skills training aligned with labor market needs, and supports the development of innovation hubs specialized in AI and Industry 4.0. Enhancing cybersecurity, ensuring platform interoperability, and facilitating technology transfer through public–private partnerships will also be critical to boost productivity and stimulate high-value innovation. Investment in R&D and education are the pillars from which the United States has become the most innovative and economically successful country in the world. However, these pillars are now under threat. President Trump has proposed a $12 billion cut to the budget of the Department of Education, significantly curtailing investment on programs geared toward making higher education more accessible. [76] The administration’s proposed cuts to federal research funding, much of which is directed toward extramural research (research conducted outside of federal facilities), will impact funding for university research, an area in which U.S. investment has been stagnant over the past decade. [77] Rather than cutting these vital programs, policymakers must take a renewed interest in the downstream effects of education and research funding. Direct government support for advanced research in strategic areas, such as nuclear power or AI, would incentivize highly focused research at top institutions. Additionally, making a concerted effort to provide specialized research grants to states and universities that have fewer PhD candidates and have a smaller R&D workforce can attract innovative thinkers to locations that, so far, lack an innovative environment. University research has a clear and positive effect on economic growth, with the societal rate of return ranging from 30 to 100 percent, leading to more technical innovations, start-ups, and productivity growth. [78] Currently, 49 percent of all STEM master’s degrees and 57 percent of all STEM doctoral degrees in the United States are earned by international students, a large share of whom remain in the country after graduation and strengthen the U.S. skilled workforce. Additionally, the United States should be streamlining the process of skilled immigration, making it easier for immigrants looking to pursue education and careers in STEM fields to move to the United States. Currently, 49 percent of all STEM master’s degrees and 57 percent of all STEM doctoral degrees are earned by international students, a large share of whom remain in the United States after graduation. [79] Limiting the flow of skilled immigration into the United States will reduce the skilled workforce of the United States, impacting global competitiveness in advanced industries. Though President Trump’s sweeping tariffs are designed to “bring manufacturing back” to the United States, the long-term impacts of Trump’s tariffs are yet to be seen. While these policies have encouraged some technology firms to make investment announcements—although many of these are yet to be seen—they have also triggered both direct and indirect retaliation. Direct measures include reciprocal tariffs, such as those China threatened following President Trump’s announcement of Liberation Day, which could choke the United States’ critical mineral supply. Indirect responses are also emerging, such as countries recalibrating their trade networks to lower their dependence on the U.S. supply chain. [80] Additionally, the Trump administration is implementing distortive measures that increase the government’s role in the market—such as taking a stake of 10 percent of the chipmaker Intel and requiring chipmakers AMD and Nvidia to pay a 15 percent tax on their sales to China—setting a dangerous precedent of state intervention. [81] To overcome the uncertainty caused by these trade barriers, state policymakers should create policies that incentivize foreign and local investment in state-specific industries. For example, New York’s Green CHIPS Act, which provided $10 billion in tax credits to firms opening semiconductor fabs in the state, was used to attract high-value, advanced manufacturing to the state of New York. [82] Similar programs can be undertaken in other states, focusing on industries in which a state is already specialized, such as biotechnology in Massachusetts, shipbuilding in Mississippi, or aerospace in Kansas and Oklahoma. The United States should implement several policies to bolster its innovation capacities and grow its advanced industry capabilities, first and foremost of which is ensuring research funding is not cut any further by the federal government. U.S. investment in research is already below that of comparable nations, ranking 11th out of 33 countries in federal R&D intensity, and with the cuts outlined by Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, that ranking is poised to fall to 21st. [83] Instead of cutting federal R&D, Congress should increase federal investment in university research and double the R&D tax credit from its current rate of 20 percent to 40 percent. Doing so would not only increase federal R&D but also attract investment from the private sector. The United States should also protect its successful patent system, a cornerstone of the country’s technological leadership. Some Trump administration officials have announced plans to change the current system by increasing revenue from patents to help cover the budget deficit. Two ideas have been examined. The first is taxing patents based on their values, which would result in an impossible-to-calculate task, disproportionately affect startups, and ultimately hamper innovation. [84] The second proposal is to impose fees on patents resulting from federal R&D grants to universities, which would reduce the incentives for university-industry collaborations and lead to fewer patents. [85] U.S. investment in research is already below that of comparable nations, ranking 11th out of 33 countries in federal R&D intensity, and with the cuts outlined by Trump’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2026, that ranking is poised to fall to 21st. Most states have economic development programs that emphasize growth in advanced technology sectors, while the federal government has its own set of fragmented programs that incentivize economic development, including regional technology hub programs under the Economic Development Administration, the Department of Defense, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Small Business Administration, leading to a fragmented set of policies for state specific economic growth. Together, these programs invest in advanced industry promotion and innovation in 48 different states, with multiple “hubs” covering the same technology areas. [86] This fragmentation has been unsuccessful. Congress should instead empower NSF’s Technology, Innovation, and Partnership (TIP) Directorate to be the leading coordinator over all these hub programs, ensuring that funding is allocated in a way that strategically targets states and industries that are poised for growth and investment, rather than casting a wide net of technology dispersion grants. Strategic investment in technology hub programs will also increase the amount of VC invested in each state. Although every state cannot create another Silicon Valley, each state has innovative industries it can capitalize on to attract capital investment. Moreover, to empower the TIP program, Congress should fully fund it at the levels specified under the CHIPS and Science Act. Supplying the $20 billion appropriated in 2022 would ensure that federal R&D dollars are used on translational research with a high technology readiness level. [87] As global trade barriers rise and political and economic uncertainty continue to spread, countries must craft policies that strengthen their resilience and competitiveness in the innovation economy. For Latin American nations, such efforts are critical to escaping the middle-income trap and remaining competitive in a fragmented global marketplace. Policymakers should pair national strategies with targeted, region-specific policy plans to address subnational challenges and to foster advanced manufacturing, nurture a skilled workforce, and develop competitive capabilities. These strategies include investment in STEM education, incentivizing R&D spending, ensuring a barrier-free patent system, and attracting high-skilled foreign professionals and foreign investment. This report has highlighted 13 different indicators that together help to measure subnational competitiveness in the innovation economy. By analyzing this index, policymakers can accrue suggestions on the specific policies they should pursue, with special attention to underdeveloped or lagging regions. For each indicator, regions’ scores were converted to a standardized score, which was capped at ±3 to avoid an outlier performance on a single indicator from too heavily influencing the composite score. For composite and category scores, a weighted-average capped standardized score (WACSS) was calculated for each indicator, wherein the weights used are those listed in the table below (normalized such that an indicator’s applied weight is equal to its listed weight divided by the sum of the listed weights—i.e., applied weights sum to one). For the composite score, this was calculated by including all indicator weights; for the category scores, this was done by including only the weights for the indicators that fall under that category. WACCS are rescaled to a 100-point scale via min-max normalization, in which the “maximum” parameter is the maximum WACCS plus one-quarter standard deviation of WACCS, and the “minimum” parameter is the minimum WACCS minus one-quarter standard deviation of WACCS. Mathematically, the WACCS of region is calculated as: wherein denotes the indicator, denotes the capped standardized score for region in indicator , and is the applied weight of indicator , defined as: such that: . The scaled score for region/UT is then calculated as: Table A1: Indicator weights and descriptions Indicator Weight Years Description Category Broadband Adoption 0.75 2021–2024 Share of households subscribing to broadband Internet Innovation Capacity Business Creation 0.50 2017–2024 Enterprise birth rate in share of employer enterprises Innovation Capacity Carbon Efficiency 0.50 2018–2023 Metric tons of CO 2 e emitted per $10,000 of PPP-adjusted GDP Innovation Capacity High-Tech Exports 0.75 2021–2024 Exports in NACIS codes 333–335 (or equivalent) as a share of GDP Globalization Highly Educated Population 1.00 2020–2024 Share of 25–64-year-old population with a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) or higher Knowledge Economy Inward FDI 0.75 2018–2023 FDI inflow as a share of GDP Globalization Manufacturing Labor Productivity 1.25 2020–2024 PPP-adjusted GVA per worker in the manufacturing sector Knowledge Economy Patent Applications 1.25 2015–2024 PCT patent applications per million residents Innovation Capacity Professional, Technical, and Scientific Employment 1.25 2023–2024 Share of employees in professional, technical, and scientific activities sector Knowledge Economy R&D Intensity 1.50 2016–2024 R&D expenditures as a share of GDP Innovation Capacity R&D Personnel 1.50 2021–2024 R&D personnel as a share of total employees Innovation Capacity Skilled Immigration 0.50 2019–2022 Share of population that is foreign born and has at least some tertiary education (ISEC 5–8) Knowledge Economy Venture Capital Received 0.75 2021–2024 Venture capital investments received as a share of GDP Innovation Capacity Subnational-level data was not available for all indicators and countries. To bridge this gap, we used proxy indicators that are available on the subnational level, and we assumed that they correlate with the original indicator. For instance, if R&D intensity data is only available on a national level, a proxy was developed using university budgets on the subnational level. The share of university budgets per region was calculated and multiplied by the national R&D intensity to develop an estimate for R&D intensity at the subnational level. The national-level R&D intensity data ensures that the estimated regional high-tech export measures are in line with national performance. For Argentina, this report built several proxies: ▪ High-Tech Exports was built using official data for industrial-based manufacturing, which is a broader term than NAICS codes 333–335. [88] ▪ Highly Educated Population was built using Census data for population over 14 years old, and proxied for the population within the 25–year–old range. [89] The share of the highly skilled population was used based on the share of graduates by province. ▪ Inward FDI was proxied using the Central Bank’s 2024 data for FDI at the country level, broken down by sector. [90] Then, using the Ministry of Economy’s sectoral data by province and Argendata’s GDP data by province, FDI was weighted based on the sector’s share within a province and the province’s share relative to the total economy. [91] ▪ Patent Applications indicator was proxied using WIPO’s total patents for Argentina, and the provincial disaggregation was estimated based on patents at the university level. [92] ▪ Professional, Technical, and Scientific Employment data was available based on CIUU rev.3 sectors, so the CIUU codes were proxied to fit into the NAICS categories covered in this indicator. [93] ▪ R&D Intensity was proxied based on the total GERD for Argentina, and disaggregated at the provincial level based on the proportion of federal funds for universities. [94] ▪ R&D Personnel was built using official science and technology indicators for total R&D employees at the national level, and the share of total R&D personnel expenditure among enterprises at the subnational level. [95] ▪ Skilled Immigration was proxied using the national average of the migrant population’s education level. [96] ▪ Venture Capital Received indicator was built using the 2024 Annual Report of Investments and Capital Markets in Argentina; as Buenos Aires and CABA appear as a single unit, the aggregated data was split in half for each. [97] Additionally, Inward FDI was proxied for Peru and Colombia. The indicator was proxied for Peru using FDI by activity type (InvestPeru data) and GDP by sector and department (INEI data). FDI activities were proxied by economic sector, and FDI by department was calculated by weighting the department’s sector intensity relative to the sector’s FDI share. [98] The indicator was proxied in the same way for Colombia using FDI by activity type (OECD data) and GDP by sector and department (OECD Regions and Cities database). [99] These estimations allow for capturing parts of the innovation competitiveness metrics of regions despite the unavailability of the exact original indicator. Subnational data or proxy data was not available for Argentina for the manufacturing labor productivity and broadband adoption indicator, Brazil for the R&D intensity indicator, for Chile for the high-tech exports indicator, and for Colombia for the highly educated population indicator.
